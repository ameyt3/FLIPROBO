But it neither paid the interest nor the principal even after maturity, according to investigators. \nThe money was siphoned off and transferred to various bank accounts of the Kanva group of companies and entities. The money was subsequently used to acquire immovable and movable properties, investigators said. \nThe entity also advanced loans from the deposits, working capital and share reserves without getting any collateral or following the rules and regulations. It didn\u2019t maintain the required liquidity or proper accounts either, investigators said. \nA number of FIRs were registered in the case, and police arrested N Nanjundaiah, the director of the Kanva group of companies, on August 25, 2020. He continues to be in jail. \nThe ED, a central government agency, started an investigation after receiving complaints from the office of the registrar of cooperative societies. \nIt subsequently searched the premises of Nanjundaiah and other directors of the SKSCCL and the Kanva group of companies, and seized the documents. \nIt has identified assets to the tune of Rs 84.4 crore and attached them provisionally under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The properties include agricultural and non-agricultural land, buildings, a flat and factories. They are in the name of Nanjundaiah, his family, related entities and Harish S, founder director and president of the SKSCCL. Besides Bengaluru, the properties are located at Nelamangala, Koratagere, Chikkabalapura, Srirangapatana and Madakasira (Andhra Pradesh). \nThis is the second time that the ED has attached properties in the Kanva case. It had earlier attached assets to the tune of Rs 255.17 crore, including accrued interest on the amount. In total, Rs 339.57 crore worth of properties have been provisionally attached in the case so far. ","1":"Bengaluru police chief Kamal Pant has suspended a sub-inspector and ordered departmental enquiry against four cops over the suicide of a 63-year-old cheating suspect in police custody. \nThe deceased, Siddalinga Swamy, reportedly jumped to his death from the balcony of his second-floor house in Vidyaranyapura, North Bengaluru, on Friday. \nSwamy, a real estate agent, was accused of taking lakhs of rupees from several people on the false promise of allotting them BDA sites. Police believe he had forged the signature and seal of several BDA officers. \nA police complaint was registered against him in December 2020 but he was arrested only on February 24. Police also got his custody to question him about the case. \nOn Friday afternoon, a team of policeman took him to his house in Vidyaranyapura for conducting mahazar (spot inspection) after he told them that he had created the fake property papers on his personal computer. \n'Ashamed to see family'\nHis wife and daughter were at home at the time. Police say he was ashamed to see his family, walked into the kitchen and jumped off the balcony. \nA senior officer said that although the policemen weren\u2019t to blame for the suicide, they should have been cautious and prevented him from ending his life. \nSpeaking to reporters on Saturday, Pant announced the suspension of sub-inspector Manjunath Kattimani, and departmental inquiry against him and head constables Ravi Aradhya, Mruthyunjaya and a constable named Umesh. They are all from the Hanumanthanagar police station.  \nAccording to the police chief, a preliminary inquiry had established the negligence of the police officers. \nThe case will now be probed by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) and there will also be a magisterial enquiry, Pant explained. ","2":"Unknown cyber fraudsters have impersonated former DG and IGP, Shankar M Bidari, 64 , and have conned one of his friends for the tune of Rs 25,000 citing some emergency. Bidari has filed a complaint with South-East CEN Crime police station on Friday seeking action against the fraudsters.\nAccording to the complaint filed by Bidari, a resident of IAS colony in BTM second stage, unknown miscreants have hacked his e-mail ID and taken the contact list from his e-mail account and have sent e-mails to all their friends asking them to transfer money citing some emergency. They also gave the account number of a nationalized bank along with IFSC code. One of his friends who believed that Bidari himself had sent the e-mail and transferred Rs 25,000 to the given bank account.  \nOn learning about the fraud Bidari has told his friends not to transfer any money or respond to any e-mails. Based on his complaint we have taken up the case under the Information Technology Act and are making efforts to nab the fraudsters, said an investigating officer. Police suggest the public not to believe e-mails, SMS, WhatsApp or any other social media messages asking for financial help, before transferring money, people should try to reach out to their friends and get the confirmation.","3":"A four-lane underpass will come up on the Outer Ring Road junction that links Ullal Main Road with Jnanabharathi in western Bengaluru. \nWhile the underpass is expected to solve traffic problems in this part of the city, it will also come with a green cost: 83 trees, some of them decades old, will have to be cut down. The underpass will be 323 metres long and cost Rs 32 crore to build. \nOn February 23, the BBMP issued a notice, seeking objections from the general public over \"evacuation of trees standing in the way of road-widening work\" for building the underpass. The BBMP has given 10 days for filing the objections. \nIf sources in the BBMP are to be believed, work on the project will start soon. \nThe Ullal junction is among the busiest in western Bengaluru, and there is little that authorities can do currently to ease the traffic congestion. \nThe underpass as a solution has its own challenges. As per the earlier alignment, it required land acquisition on either side of the outer ring road. But this wasn't feasible due to the presence of commercial establishments on the western side. The BBMP has now changed the alignment towards the Bangalore University (BU) side to reduce the need to acquire built-up properties, an official said. \nTo further minimise the cost, the BBMP is considering the cut and cover method. (This method involves digging a large trench or rectangular hole in the ground, which is then covered by a concrete deck. Once the deck is ready, traffic above can resume). \nThe project will be funded by the chief minister's Nava Nagarothana scheme. \nThe underpass will have service roads towards Magadi Road and Kengeri Road for vehicles coming from Ullal or Jnanabharathi. \nAs for the 83 trees that have to be cleared, an official associated with the project said that only old and unsustainable trees would be cut down. Most trees will be transplanted inside the university campus, the official promised. A few trees on the campus will also be removed, he added. \nNandeesh J R, Executive Engineer, RR Nagar, BBMP, said that the underpass would not only ease traffic congestion but also cut down carbon dioxide emissions. ","4":"Relief is in sight for motorists stuck at the busy Sarakki Signal, which links Kanakapura Road with the Outer Ring Road in South Bengaluru. \nThe BBMP has proposed to construct a four-lane 1.2-km-long flyover below the existing metro viaduct. A Detailed Project Report (DPR) is ready, and the BBMP is hopeful that the state government will approve it shortly and also allocate funds in the state budget for 2021-22. \nWhile the idea of building the flyover was first mooted a decade ago, the proposal has undergone many changes since then. Initially pegged at Rs 50 crore, the project is now estimated to cost 136 crore as the flyover will cover four traffic intersections: Sarakki Signal, Ilyas Nagar, 35th Main Road and JP Nagar Bus Stand. The length has been increased from 439 metres to 1.2 km, a source in the BBMP said. \n\"Initially, we had planned to build a 439-metre-long flyover over the ORR but the length has now been increased to 1.2 km to cover all traffic junctions before and after Sarakki Signal,\" said a senior BBMP engineer. \"Our aim is to avert any possible traffic gridlock because the flyover will be part of the signal-free corridor.\" \nAccording to the engineer, the idea of extending the flyover to four junctions was designed after the technical advisory committee felt that the project would serve no purpose if it is limited to Sarakki Signal alone. \nBut constructing the flyover would be easier said than done. \nKanakapura Road has undergone many changes in the past decade, the most notable being Namma Metro's Green Line, which has also made the area a hot property market. The 30.5-km-long line connects Silk Institute (on Kanakapura Road) to Nagasandra (On Tumakuru Road in North Bengaluru). \nA 13.5-metre-high viaduct carries the metro line. BBMP officials say the flyover would be built under the viaduct, at a height of 5.5 metres. \nAbdul Aleem, Co-founder, ChangeMakers of Kanakapura Road, a group of local resident welfare associations, welcomed the project. \nHe said five to six big apartment complexes, each having over 2,000 flats, and two malls were coming up on Kanakapura Road. Which means an increase in traffic congestion on the arterial road. A group of 40 RWAs had requested the state government to construct the flyover, he said. \n\"We request the government to complete the project at the earliest,\" he added.

But while the pandemic hurt many of its business lines \u2014 and forced Berkshire to again stage its forthcoming annual meeting as an online-only event, this time in Los Angeles \u2014 its profits rose 23% in the fourth quarter, as its stock investments were bolstered by soaring markets.\nAmong the biggest winners in Berkshire\u2019s vast investment portfolio was its 5.4% stake in Apple, whose shares have been among the top market winners over the past year. In his annual letter to investors that accompanied the company\u2019s financial results, Buffett noted that the iPhone maker was now one of his company\u2019s three biggest assets, with its stake worth $120 billion as of Dec. 31. (Berkshire calculates that it paid $31 billion for its holdings.)\nAnd Buffett, who is Berkshire\u2019s chairman and CEO, professed enthusiasm for another investment: Berkshire\u2019s own shares. The conglomerate spent $24.7 billion buying back its own stock last year and said that it has spent more money doing so since.\nTo Buffett, stock repurchases may not be immediately exciting, but they give existing Berkshire shareholders even more of a stake in what he called \u201cexceptional businesses.\u201d\nBut Buffett\u2019s stock repurchases suggest that the huge amounts of cash that Berkshire generates every year from its insurance holdings \u2014 which he has called his \u201celephant gun\u201d \u2014 are unlikely to be spent on the kind of major corporate acquisitions that have been among his signature business achievements. Berkshire ended last year with $138 billion in cash, an enormous pile that he must find ways to spend.\nBuffett also admitted to a big mistake: the $37.2 billion that he paid in 2016 to buy Precision Castparts, a maker of airplane parts, in what was the company\u2019s biggest-ever takeover. Precision Castparts has failed to live up to expectations, leading up to an $11 billion accounting write-down that Buffett called \u201cugly.\u201d","13":"Swedish furniture major IKEA, which has a range of over 1,000 products as part of its children's range, is looking to scale up sourcing of toys from India for its operations here, said a top company official.\nBesides, IKEA India is also aiming to have around 12 per cent of sales from kids' range of products in the coming years.\nThe company, which currently sources only cotton-based soft toys from India, is also exploring to expand in some other categories such as wooden toys, said IKEA India Country Commercial Manager Kavitha Rao.\nIKEA, which has participated in the India Toy Fair, said it is exploring opportunities to partner with several players in the toy segment, which is a big focus area of the company.\nWhen being asked whether IKEA is going to increase sourcing of toys from India, Rao told PTI, \"Of course, yes. That is one of the main reasons why we are part of the toys fair.\"\n\"Because we could be a large buyer and of course, it is contingent on meeting standards and design thoughts\u2026 but we feel that there is a great opportunity for us to come together with some potential suppliers as part of the player as well,\" she added.\nIn India, 80 per cent of the households live with children.\n\"IKEA has a fairly large range of over 1,000 products as part of its children's range, which contributes around 6-8 per cent currently, and we aim to reach 10-12 per cent in the near future,\" Rao said.\nBesides toys, the range covers beds and mattresses specifically made for children, ergonomic storage and seating solutions made for a child, among others.\nIKEA said the India Toy Fair would help it connect with new partners and understand the ecosystem here.\n\"That is also the reason why we are participating in the toy fair, organised by the Government of India because it gives us an opportunity to also understand what the ecosystem is,\" she added.\nBesides cotton, IKEA is sensing an opportunity to source wooden toys for its stores.\n\"If you look at our range, we do have a range of wooden-based toys. So, if we had the opportunity to source some of that from India, we would definitely like to explore it,\" said Rao.\nHowever, she also added that IKEA with forestry-certified wood, as it always sources from sustainable sources.\nRecently, the government has created eight toy clusters with some significant investments in that space.\n\"We feel that it is a great approach because it will also give us the opportunity to look at possibilities for sourcing toys locally, from within India as well,\" she said adding that \"this is a huge initiative and a big focus area for us\".\nIKEA is working on new categories like furniture, mattress and sofas, besides building the textiles category which India is traditionally strong.\nUnder the FDI policy for single-brand retailers, a local sourcing requirement of 30 per cent of the value of goods is mandated. This can be met as an average during the first five years, and thereafter annually towards its Indian operations.\nHowever, in August 2019, the government amended the provision by adding that all procurements made from India by a single-brand retailer for that brand shall be counted towards local sourcing, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported.\nIKEA has been sourcing from India for its global operations for close to 35 years. It is working with around 60 suppliers. IKEA India had opened its second retail store in Mumbai last December and is working on its next store in Bengaluru.\nPart of Ingka Group, IKEA India had opened its first retail store in Hyderabad in August 2018, followed by online stores in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune.\nOn Saturday, while inaugurating the first India Toy Fair 2021, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the toy manufacturers to use less plastic and more eco-friendly material, in addition to focus on innovation.\nHe regretted that India's share in the $100-billion global toy market is very less, and about 85 per cent of the toys sold in the country are imported.

If you owe anything to them, pay it off. The late payment interest, penalty, late fees, etc., are at least twice the interest one pays on bank borrowings. Holding on to Government money does not make any commercial sense.\nWhile filing Income Tax Returns, we come across many instances of non or delayed payment of taxes resulting in penal interests. So, the rule is to comply with the due dates.\nHere are some areas worth looking at to earn the benefits:\nAdvance Tax\nWill salaried employees also pay interest on Income Tax? Not on salary income, as they are subject to withholding taxes (TDS). If they have, say Interest income, then the banker deducts TDS at 10% on term deposits and no TDS on Saving Bank interest. This won\u2019t cover the full tax liability if the taxpayer is in the higher tax slabs. Likewise, a whole lot of other income such as Rental Income, profit on shares trading, capital gain on Mutual Funds, dividend, etc., attract taxes, but most of them are not subject to TDS provisions.\nUnder the Income Tax Law, if a person has a tax liability of more than Rs 10,000 a year (except senior citizens not having professional income), then he is liable to pay Advance\nTax in four installments, i.e., before July 15, September 15, December 15 and March 15.\nIf the advance tax is not paid, then 1% interest per month is payable u\/s 234C for deferment in instalment and 1% interest per month is payable u\/s 234B if 90% of the tax is\nnot paid before the end of the financial year towards default in payment of advance tax.\nLate fee for Belated filing\nThis is a lesser-known fact that if Income Tax Returns (ITR) is not filed within the due dates, u\/s 234F, one has to mandatorily pay a late fee at the time of filing the return. For example, the due date for filing the ITR for FY 2019-20 was January 10, 2021, but one can file the belated return before March 31, 2021 by paying a late fee of Rs 1,000 in case the taxable income is below Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10,000 in case the taxable income is over Rs 5 lakh. Additionally, u\/s 234A, interest at 1% is payable for the delay in filing the return.\nRevision of ITR\nThere is a provision under IT Act to revise the ITR at a subsequent date, (to rectify mistakes, if any) if the return is filed within the due date.\nCarry Forward of Loss\nSimilarly, Losses from business (except unabsorbed depreciation) or Sale of capital assets can\u2019t be carried forward to the subsequent year to set off against future income, if the ITR is not filed within the due dates.\nETDS Return\nQuarterly TDS returns have to be filed by the deductor of Tax. For example, any person who is paying rent or buys property from an NRI has to deduct TDS, pay and file the TDS return. Non-Compliance attracts a late fee u\/s 234E of Rs 200 per day, every day during which the failure continues.\nResponse to Notices\nIf one fails to reply to Income Tax Notices, say, for scrutiny assessments, the department can finalise the tax liability as they deem fit, (usually unfavourable to the taxpayer) based on the information available with them, called as Best Judgment assessment. This apart, the taxpayer can also be fined for failure to respond to the Notices.\nInvest in tax saving instruments\nSection 80C provides tax exemption up to Rs 1.50 lakh if the individual or the HUF taxpayer invests or spends in the specified products before the end of the year. For FY 2020-21, such investments are to be done before March 31, 2021. If one misses this date, he loses the benefit.\nProperty Tax\nThe Municipal authorities offer a discount for those owners who pay the Property Tax within the due dates set by them. So, paying early fetches incentives!\nInsurance\nIt is a well-known fact that driving a vehicle with no insurance or expired insurance is illegal. Further, to renew the policy after the expiry date, inspection of the vehicle is mandatory! Not just that, if the renewal is done after 90 days, be prepared to lose the No Claim Bonus (NCB) benefits. Renew by the click of a button without any toil, if done within the expiry date. Those who have failed to pay Electricity bills within the due dates will encounter the\nthreat of disconnection of electricity.\nInterest on borrowings\nThe late payment of EMIs will attract a penalty. Defaulting will drastically reduce credit score (CIBIL Score) and impact the ability to receive future credit and may even lead to seizure of the property.\nA casual approach towards due dates and non-compliance will either deprive the benefits or burden the pocket! Contrarily, adherence to due dates will not only save money but also\nearn peace of mind.

A recent survey by JobsforHer, a job portal for women reiterates that outdated skills were one of the biggest deterrents for women trying to return to work. In fact, about 34% of women cited reskilling as a necessity for their career restart, progression, and job role changes. Another 36% said that they were looking at technical skills for reskilling\/ upskilling. The survey also finds that 61% of women professionals find better career opportunities after getting reskilled after a career break.\nIt still has been difficult to get women to join these courses.

The same holds for women, as upskilling will help accelerate their careers and bring more women into the workforce, who would have given up jobs at various stages of their life. However, it has been a challenge across platforms to attract and encourage more women to upskill and reskill themselves,\u201d says Saxena.\nUpskilling platform UpGrad has witnessed a 12% increase in women\u2019s enrolment numbers as compared to men before and after the arrival of Covid-19, according to Co-founder Phalgun Kompalli. While the women enrolments accounted for 1\/3rd of male enrolments in the pre-Covid phase, this ratio has now shifted to become 2\/5th in the post-Covid phase in Q2.\nWhile upskilling has now become a sure-shot route to grab a job, the fact that not many women are taking part, for reasons of accessibility, awareness or resources, is serious to the issue of bridging the gender divide at work.  \nIn October 2018, VMware, a software company announced a new initiative designed to address the increasing gender gap in the technology sector. VMinclusion Taara, an up-skilling and return-to-work programme, aims to support women who want to get back to the workforce.\nThe programme has received close to 9,500 registrations since going live in January 2019. Over 5,000 women have registered during the pandemic in 2020. \nUnder this programme are certifications on the latest IT solutions in Datacenter, Networking, Cloud and Cloud Management technologies.\nSupriya Menon, Director, Education, VMware India says, \u201cA potent mix of years of social conditioning and bias has traditionally kept women out of the workforce, while the ones who stayed have had to deal with significant bias. This might also be an indication as to why women are under-represented in STEM and don\u2019t make it back post a career break.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, while there has been a significant rise in the number of women joining the STEM curriculum, there is a huge leakage of talent post joining work. In our experience, it is evident that they are looking for opportunities but factors like lack of resources, family support, career guidance, and a supportive ecosystem can drastically affect the numbers.\u201d\nTo address this issue and encourage more women to upskill themselves, Scaler has also recently launched a unique career accelerator initiative called \u201cScaler Include\u201d.\n\u201cUnder this initiative, in collaboration with organisations, we identify & train a diverse talent - women and LGBTQ community members who are passionate about technology and help them establish their career in tech roles,\u201d says Saxena.","20":"The Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB), a statutory body of the Karnataka government, has envisaged development of new industrial townships and sector-specific investment clusters across the state to facilitate industrial development.\nThe Board is presently holding a land bank of 15,000 acres and is also in the process of acquiring another 15,000 acres to develop new industrial areas. N Shivashankar, Chief Executive Officer & Executive Member, KIADB explains to Mahesh Kulkarni of DH the Board's plans for the development of new industrial townships. Excerpts:\nA decade ago, Karnataka government was not in possession of a large parcel of land to meet the requirement of big-ticket investors like Tata Motors. What have you done to address the investors' requirement for land?\nWe have embarked on the development of land banks across the state to facilitate the development of industries. We have acquired land in many districts to create a land bank. Very rarely, we get a request for a large piece of land from industries and now we are equipped to meet such requirements. The KIADB is also developing sector-specific industrial parks.  \nHow much land do you currently have in your possession?\nHistorically, we have acquired and developed about 75,000 acres of land in the state. So far, we have allotted 50,000 acres across 178 industrial estates. Currently, in our land bank, we have around 15,000 acres of land ready for allotment. We have also acquired land along the upcoming Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor and Bengaluru-Mumbai Industrial Corridor.\nWhat are your plans to develop industrial townships along these two industrial corridors?\nAlong the CBIC, we have already developed around 3,500 acres of land in three phases at Vasanthnarasapura in Tumakuru district. We are now in the process of developing another 1,722 acres as part of the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. The development is being taken up by the Tumakuru Industrial Township Limited (TITL) jointly with the government of India. Both the central and state governments will contribute equal equity for this project. While the state government is giving Rs 600 crore worth of land, the central government is contributing Rs 600 crore equity into the special purpose vehicle, which is named CBIC-TITL.\nIn total, the CBIC-TITL will be developing 9,000 acres of land in multiple phases over the next few years. To begin with, the first phase development will be taken up for 1,722 acres. Very soon, we will be floating global EPC tenders for the development of the first phase. It is expected that the tenders will be finalised by August and the work will begin by September this year. Our plan is to develop this greenfield industrial township on the model of Shendra Bidkin industrial node and Dholera industrial estate on the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. Our new township will be an integrated park with common amenities, business centre and residential layouts. It will have specific area allotted for different sectors such as pharma, textile, chemicals and manufacturing among others.\nWhen will this park be ready for allotment of land?\nOnce we award the contract sometime in September this year, the work will begin. We expect about 50% of the work to be completed in a year after that and then, the allotment of land will begin. Overall, in the next three years, it will be fully ready. Around 1,000 acres will be available for allotment to industries.\nWhat are your plans to cater to large industrial projects?\nVery rarely, big industries come with a requirement for over thousand acres. If there are any such applications, we are ready to provide land or acquire it within six months and provide. We have enough land parcel for medium scale industries. For example, Aequs Group wants 400 acres to develop electronics and consumer durable equipment manufacturing unit in Hubballi. We are giving them land.\nDo you have any plans to recover land from industries that fail to set up factories?\nYes, we will recover the unused land if investors fail to set up an industry within five years from the date of allotment of land. There is a process we have to follow. In case anyone wants to change the land use, they have to apply to us and seek permission.\nHave you taken back land from any industry so far?\nIn fact, we have written to some of them asking why there is a delay. For example, we have written to ArcelorMittal asking them why are they delaying their steel plant in Ballari. We are waiting for their reply. In the case of Coca Cola, they have already surrendered their land at Yadgir industrial estate.\nWhat are your plans to develop sector-specific industrial clusters?\nWe have taken steps to develop many such clusters. For example, we are developing a pharmaceutical industry cluster at Yadgir. We have already allotted close to 1,000 acres land to many pharma companies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. There is a lot of demand from pharma companies for land in Yadgir because it is closer to Hyderabad. We are also building a common effluent treatment plant for all the industries. We have also developed a new machine tool park at Vasanthnarasapura Industrial Area in Tumakuru district, which is now ready for allotment. Adjacent to this, we have developed a Japanese Industrial Township spread over 520 acres, where land will be allotted to only Japanese companies. Two companies including Toyota have already taken land in the park.","21":"Any sale or gift of a property by a foreigner without RBI\u2019s prior permission would be illegal, the Supreme Court has ruled.\n\u201cWe hold that the condition predicated in Section 31 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, of obtaining \u201cprevious\u201d general or special permission of the RBI for the transfer or disposal of immovable property situated in India by sale or mortgage by a person, who is not a citizen of India, is mandatory,\u201d said a bench presided over by Justice A M Khanwilkar.\n\u201cUntil such permission is accorded, in law, the transfer cannot be given effect to; and for contravening with that requirement,\u201d the bench, also comprising Justices Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi,\nadded.\nHowever, the court declared that transactions that have already become final, including by virtue of the decision of the court of competent jurisdiction, need not be reopened or disturbed in any manner because of this pronouncement.\n\u201cThis direction is being issued in exercise of our plenary power under Article 142 of the Constitution. For, there has been a paradigm shift in the general policy of investment by foreigners in India and more particularly, the 1973 Act itself stands repealed,\u201d the bench said.\nThe court was dealing with a suit property, measuring 12,306 square feet at Bengaluru, which was gifted in March 1977 by the widow of Charles Raitt, a foreigner and owner to Vikram Malhotra, without obtaining previous permission of the RBI. It set aside the Karnataka High Court\u2019s order which confirmed the trial court\u2019s decision allowing the deal.\nThe court referred to the legislative intent and the spirit of enactment of Section 31, which, it said, was manifest from the statement of the then Finance Minister while tabling the Bill in the Lok Sabha that as a general policy foreign national cannot be allowed to deal with real estate in India.\n\u201cThere is little doubt that the requirement of \u201cprevious\u201d permission of the RBI, to be taken by a foreign national before transacting in real estate, is mandatory. In other words, without the previous permission of the RBI, such a transaction is forbidden and if entered into, would be unenforceable in law,\u201d the court said.","22":"Remaining net buyers for second consecutive month in this calendar year, overseas investors pumped in Rs 23,663 crore in Indian markets in February on account of positive sentiment due to the Union Budget 2021-22 and strong third-quarter earnings.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPI) invested a net Rs 25,787 crore into equities but pulled out Rs 2,124 crore from the bonds market during February 1-26, the depositories data showed.\nThis took the total net investment to Rs 23,663 crore during the period under review.\nLast month, the total net investment stood at Rs 14,649 crore.\nRusmik Oza, executive vice-president and head (fundamental research) at Kotak Securities, said, \"Most of the FPI flows this month can be attributed to the strong outcome of the Union Budget and third quarter earnings season.\"\nBesides, Geojit Financial Chief Investment Strategist V K Vijayakumar noted that the pace of FPI inflows has slowed since the US 10-year yield is spiking up.\nThe US 10-year bond yield is a hugely important determinant of capital flows. Inflation expectations are pushing the yields up. This will slow capital inflows, he added.\nOza said the yield, which started the calendar year at 0.91 per cent, has now risen to 1.47 per cent. \"It has led to bond yields rising across the globe.\"\nAlso, USD 1.9-trillion stimulus coming from US government could lead to sharper recovery in the US GDP in this calender year.\n\"Markets are forward looking and trying to build in the scope of further rise in bond yields going forward in spite of the pick-up in vaccination,\" Oza said.\nAccording to Oza, emerging market currencies need to be watched going forward.\nCountries that see higher impact on their currencies could see higher FPI outflows, he added.\nMorningstar India Associate Director (Manager Research) Himanshu Srivastava said the focus will be on economic numbers and how soon India gain economic momentum back, moving forward.\nThere are signs of improvement in the macroeconomic environment and earnings growth, and foreign investors would prefer this trend to continue.\n\"However, as markets continue to be at elevated levels and given high valuations, the possibility of profit-booking remains, which could slow down the pace of net flows,\" he said.\nBesides, with the US Federal Reserve reaffirming its accommodative stance, the global liquidity backdrop remains positive, which could enable flows into emerging markets like India, Srivastava said. ","23":"Chief Economic Advisor K V Subramanian has backed a proposal to bring petroleum products under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST).\nHe, however, said the decision will have to be taken by the GST council.\n\"It will be a good move, but the decision rests with the GST Council,\" Subramanian said during a recent interaction with FICCI FLO members.\nPetroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had also urged Union Finance Minister Nirmalya Sitharaman to bring petroleum products under the ambit of the GST.\nContinuous rise in fuel prices has burdened the common man and become a political issue in states where assembly elections are due.\nSubramanian also said inflationary pressures are mostly on account of \"food inflation\".","24":"Private health insurers are encouraging their customers to lead healthy and active lives by offering steep discounts on the renewal premia between 80 and 100 per cent, along with a host of other rewards and benefits.\nMost health insurance provides no-claim bonus for claim-free years but that usually ranges from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.\nWhile Aditya Birla Health Insurance is offering up to 100 per cent return of the premium if the customer has accrued adequate number of 'Activ Dayz' (one Activ Day means 10,000 steps a day, or any fitness activity specified by the insurer), another firm Future Generali earlier this month launched a policy offering a flat 80 per cent discount on renewal if the customer did not make any claim in the previous policy year.\nAditya Birla Health will give a customer up to 100 per cent health returns if the insured earned enough health returns by looking after his\/her health by being physically active on a regular basis.\nThe insurer will monitor the active lives of its customers through the Activ Health app.\nThe company said the new product is an enhanced version of its existing Activ Health policy offering extensive wellness benefits for those customers who lead a healthier lives.\nLast week, Aditya Birla Health Insurance claimed that it is the only insurance company offering up to 100 per cent discount on the premium and up to 100 per cent reload of the sum insured through this enhanced version of the Activ Health policy.\nExplaining the features, its Chief Executive Officer Mayank Bathwal said the company has been consistently encouraging policyholders to stay active and healthy.\nThe new policy is an industry-first initiative, offering up to 100 per cent health returns through incentive-based health and wellness programmes, he said.\n\"A customer can get up to 100 per cent health returns on the renewal premium by completing the adequate number of Activ Dayz (one Activ Dayz is equal to 10,000 steps or 300 calories burned or a daily 30 minute gym session or a fitness assessment test every six months).\n\"This offering is a wellness programme beyond reactive care insurance that is suitable for all,\" Bathwal told PTI.\nRead | Insurance most preferred financial product to protect family post-Covid-19: Study\nA consumer is rewarded through a cash-equivalent that can be used for either health-related expenses like buying medicines, paying for diagnostic tests, day care treatment, out-patient expenses, and alternative treatments, or can be used towards the payment of future premium, it added.\nIt also offers double sum insured in two claim-free years, which means such a customer can earn 50 per cent no-claim bonus for every claim-free year and a maximum up to 100 per cent of the sum insured.\nEarlier this month, Future Generali India Insurance launched a health super saver policy offering a flat 80 per cent discount on the premium in the consecutive years, provided there was no claim in the first and the second years.\nThe policy has two variants \u2014 1X and 2X. Super saver 1X plan gives 80 per cent discount on the premium on renewal if the previous year was claim-free, while the super saver 2X plan offers the policyholder up to 80 per cent discount on the premium for the next consecutive two years of the plan, if the first two years of the plan tenure were claim-free or up to first claim.\nFurther, an additional family discount of 10 per cent also is available if two or more family members are covered on an individual sum insured basis.\nThe product can be bought by a one-day old infant and a senior citizen of 70.\nExplaining the features, its Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Anup Rau had told PTI that a customer would get 80 per cent off in the second year if there was no claim in the first year with no other conditions.\nHe said the objective is to instill the need and importance of health insurance among the youth as they are mostly reluctant to pay health premia considering this as a loss if there is no claim raised. ","25":"Saudi Aramco has asked banks to extend by a year a $10 billion loan it raised last May, two sources familiar with the matter said, suggesting that rebounding crude prices are not pushing the oil giant to reduce debt for the time being.\nThe sources confirmed a report by Loan Pricing Corporation, a fixed-income news provider owned by Refinitiv.\nIt is at the banks' discretion whether to extend the loan, but lenders will likely agree in order to maintain a good relationship with Aramco in the hope of receiving future business, LPC said citing a banker.\nOne of the sources, who confirmed the report, echoed that, saying: \"It's Aramco. Why not?\"\nAramco declined to comment.\nRead | Saudi Aramco may sell more shares if market conditions are right\nLPC cited a banker as saying it was possible Aramco would try to push down pricing by arguing that market conditions have improved since May, when oil prices were much lower and there was much uncertainty about the pandemic.\nThe loan started at 50 basis points over LIBOR, a rate that steps up as more money is drawn from the facility, one of the sources told Reuters, adding Aramco could try to reduce pricing by 10 to 15 bps.\nBrent crude futures settled at $66.13 a barrel last week. In May last year they were trading at around $30 a barrel, as global demand plunged due to the coronavirus crisis.\nSources told Reuters last year that Aramco would use the loan to back its acquisition of a 70% stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, a deal worth almost $70 billion.\nLPC had previously reported, citing a banker, that the loan would be repaid with the proceeds from a bond sale by the fourth quarter of 2020. That did not happen, even though Aramco raised $8 billion in a multi-tranche bond deal in November.\nSaudi Aramco's profits plummeted last year, but it stuck to a promised $75 billion annual dividend, most of which goes to the Saudi government.\nHSBC said this month that Aramco's prospects look more positive and promising for 2021, hinting at declining net debt and a possible dividend hike.","26":"Karnataka, which is home to India\u2019s first Aerospace SEZ, electronics city and several IT parks, is now ready with India\u2019s first integrated machine tool park.\nThe park, spread over 530 acres at Vasanthnarasapura, about 90 kms from Bengaluru, is developed under the scheme of Enhancement of Competitiveness in Indian Capital Goods Sector (ECICGS), jointly by the state government and the Department of Heavy Industries, Government of India.\nThe Indian Machine Tools Manufacturers Association (IMTMA), has provided the technical assistance to the country\u2019s biggest machine tool park which is ready for occupation.\nBoth the state and central governments have set up a special purpose vehicle named Tumakuru Machine Tool Park (TMTP) to develop the new industrial cluster. It has 158 ready-to-build industrial plots of various dimensions. The park is fully developed with proper layout, concrete roads, footpath, drainage, electricity, water linkage and even bus shelters.\n\u201cThe government of India has set an ambitious target of achieving $5 trillion economy by 2025, of which the manufacturing sector contribution will be around $1 trillion. Within the manufacturing sector, the role of machine tools is vital. To achieve these targets, we need to build a robust machine tool ecosystem and TMTP is an attempt in that direction,\u201d V Anbu, Secretary, Director General & CEO of Indian Machine Tool Manufacturers\u2019 Association (IMTMA) told DH.\n\nTumakuru Machine Tool Park. Credit: DH Infographics\n\nHe said the machine tool park was conceived about eight years ago and with the support of department of heavy industries, the government of India and Karnataka governments, the park has become a reality and is set to play an important role in consolidating Karnataka\u2019s numero uno position in the manufacture of machine tools.\nAlready, Karnataka is the third highest contributing state for heavy engineering in India. It accounts for 52% of India\u2019s total share in machine tool production and 62% of machine tool exports. The machine tool industry is estimated to have dropped by 30% to touch Rs 6,500 crore in 2019-20 and is set to bounce back in FY21.\nMany global and Indian companies such as TaeguTec, Yuken, HMT, BFW, AMS, Makino, Bosch, Kennametal and Liebherr are operating out of Karnataka.\nThe Tumakuru Machine Tool Park is developed at a cost of Rs 508 crore, of which Rs 125 crore each is the equity contribution of Karnataka and Central governments.\nOut of 158 industrial parks at TMTP, some of the large companies have taken 22 plots spread over 128 acres and the balance plots are available for sale. The TMTP will have some of the common facilities like common engineering facility centre, test & certification centre, incubation centre for startups, technical centre for training, seminars and conferences. It is located within the Tumakuru Industrial Township on the Chennai-Bengaluru Industrial Corridor.\n\u201cThe main idea of TMTP was to develop the machine tool industry. The park is located at the Tumakuru node of Chennai Bengaluru Industrial Corridor. Very soon, there will be a dedicated railway line between Tumakuru and Davanagere that will pass through Vasanthnarasapura,\u201d N Shivashankar, CEO, TMTP said.\nOver the next few years, Tumakuru will emerge as a massive industrial hub in Karnataka, he added.\nAdvantages\nThe advantages of TMTP are its proximity to Dabhol-Bangalore gas pipeline, and quick access to Bangalore international airport (105 kms). The nearest seaport at Mangaluru is just about 350 kms away. It is also located 4 kms from the national highway connecting Bengaluru with Pune.\nAt TMTP, the land is offered at a concessional rate of Rs 1 crore per acre, while the cost of land at other industrial parks nearby is in excess of Rs 1.20 crore per acre. All new manufacturing industries coming into production by March 2023 will have a reduced corporate tax rate of 15%, which is a major step to encourage investments in the machine tools park, said P J Mohanram, Senior Advisor, IMTMA.\n\u201cThe big advantage for machine tool companies to establish their plants at TMTP is not only the domestic market, but that they can look at serving the entire south east Asian market. It will offer huge cost advantage compared to operating from Germany,\u201d he said.\nAnother major advantage is that the TMTP is situated opposite the upcoming Japanese Industrial Township, where industrial plots are offered to only Japanese companies. At TMTP, plots are reserved exclusively for machine tool companies (both Indian and multinational). In addition to the land, there is an availability of trained manpower in the surrounding areas. Tumakuru is home to three engineering colleges that produce required engineering graduates.\nSome of the machine tool companies that have taken land at TMTP include Coastal Chrome India, Ace Multi Axes Systems Ltd, Anupam CNC Machining Pvt Ltd, Amwin Machining Pvt Ltd, Advance Cooling and Nayak Precisions among others.\nMany other companies like Pragati Automation, BFW, Trishul, Ace Designers and Jyoti CNC have evinced interest to acquire land in the park, according to KIADB.","27":"The Centre has unveiled a mobile application for effective monitoring or wholesale and retail prices of 22 essential commodities on a daily basis.\nWith the launch of the app, static data entry of prices of essential commodities is set to be consigned to history books as price reporting centres will now have to specify details of markets and shops from where the prices are collected.\n\u201cThe daily report of prices and indicative price trends are analysed for taking appropriate decisions such as the release of stocks from the buffer and export-import policy,\u201d a government official said.\nThe Department of Consumer Affairs monitors prices of rice, wheat, wheat flour, gram dal, tur\/arhar Dal, urad dal, moong Dal, masoor Dal, sugar, milk, groundnut oil, mustard oil, vanaspati, soya oil, sunflower oil, palm oil, gur, tea, salt, potato, onion and tomato.\nThe price data is being collected from 127 centres across the country through food and civil supplies departments of state governments.\nAs per the guidelines for retail price reporting, the prices of the same variety of a commodity are to be collected from three markets \u2013 high-income market, middle-income market and low-income market, and the average of the three prices is to be reported.\nThe department said that the mobile app has an inbuilt feature to calculate and report the average price.\nThis helps in avoiding human errors in calculation.

The support of citizens is very important,\u201d Randeep said, urging citizens to take up the Swachh Survekshan survey to provide better feedback.\nLive interactions took place between volunteers, BBMP workers and citizens during the run. Citizens took a pledge to avoid using single-use plastic, stop littering and take part in volunteer activities.\n\u201cIt is not just about picking up trash. We need to own our streets and make sure that we don\u2019t let ourselves or others throw trash on the road,\u201d V Nagaraj, popularly known as Plog Raj, told DH.

A video clip of the incident, which has gone viral on social media, showed a group of people holding BJP flags and trying to block the convoy of Gogoi, who was going to attend a meeting at Bahjani under Barkhetri constituency in Nalbari district.\nGogoi said, \"This planned attack shows how much BJP is rattled with the rise of the AJP. The administration should take strict action and I request the Election Commission to hold free and fair polls.\"\nElections to the northeastern state will be conducted in three phases - on March 27, April 1 and April 6.\n\"AJP adviser Basanta Deka called up the DGP and demanded action into the incident. Our vice-president Chandra Kanta Das also informed the home secretary about the attack,\" Rahman said.\nSenior BJP leaders could not be immediately reached for comment.\nThe AJP has forged an alliance with the Raijor Dal, led by jailed anti-CAA activist Akhil Gogoi, for the upcoming elections.","48":"The opposition Congress-led Grand Alliance in Assam on Sunday said its chief ministerial candidate will be decided in consultation with other constituents after the assembly elections are over.\nAddressing a joint press conference of the partners of the Grand Alliance, All India Congress Committee general secretary, in-charge of Assam, Anirudh Singh, said that the prime concern of the grouping is to defeat the BJP and its partners.\n\"After the polls are over, all the parties will sit together and decide about the chief ministerial candidate,\" he said.\nWith the joining of the Hagrama Mohilary-led Bodoland People's Front (BPF) in the opposition grouping, the Grand Alliance will surely reach its target of winning 101 out of the total 126 assembly seats in the upcoming polls, Singh said.\nRead | Grand alliance will defeat BJP in Assam and form government, says former BJP ally BPF\nThe Congress, which was earlier in power for 15 years in the northeastern state since 2001, had initially formed the Grand Alliance with the AIUDF, CPI, CPI(M), CPI(ML) and the Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM) to fight the assembly polls against the BJP-helmed National Democratic Alliance (NDA).\nOn Saturday, the BPF joined the alliance to add to the strength of the anti-BJP grouping.\nRJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had also met several leaders of the alliance on Friday and Saturday and said his party will contest the Assam assembly polls although no formal decision was taken to join the grouping. The BPF which was a part of the BJP-led state government had announced on Saturday that it will no longer maintain any friendly relation or alliance with the ruling BJP.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mohilary said, \"The BJP failed to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Assam. It has failed to give the rights to indigenous people. The saffron party disrespected all tribal people.\"\nExuding confidence that the Grand Alliance will form the government with full majority, the BPF leader said that the saffron party will be \"finished\" in the assembly polls.\nElections in the northeastern state will be conducted on March 27, April 1 and April 6.\nWhen asked if the three BPF ministers in the BJP-led government will resign, Mohilary refused to give a direct answer, saying \"What is there to resign now? Model code of conduct is in force in the state.\"\nAssam Congress president Ripun Bora also invited two new regional parties \u2014 Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal \u2014 to join the grouping to defeat the BJP-led alliance.\nRead | Congress looking for much-needed wins in upcoming assembly polls with the help of allies\nThe All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) organisational general secretary Aminul Islam requested the BPF to unite all the tribal and ethnic groups to put a consolidated fight against the ruling NDA.\n\"The RJD leadership also came and made a commitment to campaign anywhere in the state in favour of the Grand Alliance. This will benefit us immensely,\" the AIUDF leader added.\nThe BJP will be going to the Assam polls with allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL).\nThe 2016 assembly elections in Assam had given a fractured mandate and no party got an absolute majority. The Congress had won 26 seats, while the AIUDF bagged 13. The BJP became the single largest party with 60 MLAs, while its allies Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and BPF had won 14 and 12 seats respectively. The ruling coalition also had the support of an Independent MLA.","49":"Three days after Leader of the Opposition in the State Assembly, Tejashwi Yadav, quoted the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) to buttress his point that there has been a 101.02 per cent increase in crime in Bihar, armed assailants gunned down a Congress MLA Santosh Mishra\u2019s nephew Sanjeev Mishra.\nThe incident took place on Saturday evening at Sasaram when Sanjeev was coming out of his house to buy some medicines from a nearby shop. The marauders shot him from close range. One of the bullets hit Sanjeev on his head.\nHe was rushed to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (which is closer to Sasaram than the state capital Patna) for better treatment, but the MLA\u2019s nephew succumbed to injuries on the way.\nSanjeev had extensively campaigned for his uncle Santosh Mishra who was one of the few Congress leaders to triumph in the November 2020 Assembly elections. \u201cSanjeev had plans to contest the ensuing panchayat polls in Bihar and he had been extensively moving around in the area,\u201d informed a family source here on Sunday.\n\u201cThe killing reflects how poor the law and order situation is in Bihar. If the relative of a legislator is not safe in the state, then imagine the plight of a common man. Crime, of late, has increased manifold. However, the government is busy passing the buck,\u201d said the Congress MLA, Santosh Mishra, whose father GN Mishra was a minister in the previous Congress regime.\nMeanwhile, Rohtas SP, Ashish Bharti, is personally monitoring the situation and has deployed adequate police force in the area to avert any backlash.\nIn the meantime, the Nitish regime Sunday appointed Chaitanya Prasad as the Principal Secretary, Home, in place of Amir Subhani, who was elevated as Development Commissioner.","50":"An anti-defacement drive has been launched in Assam for removing banners, hoardings and graffiti to enforce provisions of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), the state election office said.\nThe MCC came into force on February 26, when the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced the assembly polls for five states, including Assam.\n\"Over 1.34 lakh defacements were removed on the first two days after announcement of the election schedule by the ECI,\" an official release said. Teams engaged by the district administration removed 50,927 banners and hoardings, 734,069 posters and ensured whitewashing of 10,085 walls, the release said. The three-phase assembly elections in Assam will be conducted on March 27, April 1 and April 6.","51":"By Katherine Chiglinsky\nWarren Buffett\u2019s 15-page annual letter to shareholders on Saturday made mention of the pandemic that ravaged the globe in 2020 exactly once: One of his furniture companies had to close for a time because of the virus, the billionaire noted on page nine.\nBuffett likewise steered clear of politics, despite the contested presidential election and riots at the U.S. Capitol, and never touched on race or inequality even after protests and unrest broke out in cities across the nation last year. He also avoided delving into the competitive deal-making pressures faced by his conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a topic routinely dissected in past year\u2019s letters.\n\u201cHere you have a company with such a revered leader who\u2019s held in such high regard -- whose opinion matters, who has businesses that were directly impacted by the pandemic, insurance companies that were influenced by global warming and social inflation -- and there was not one word about the pandemic,\u201d Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in a phone interview. \u201cThat to me was striking. It was tone deaf and it was disappointing.\u201d\nBuffett, 90, has been unusually quiet since last year\u2019s annual meeting in May amid a multitude of issues facing Americans. His annual letters are often seen as a chance to offer investors help in understanding his thinking on broad topics and market trends, in addition to details on how his conglomerate is faring.\nRead | Why Warren Buffett won\u2019t take the Reddit bait\nBut the Berkshire chief executive officer carefully weighs his words, and some topics, such as the pandemic, risk veering into highly controversial political territory, Jim Shanahan, an analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co., said in an interview.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of comments about the pandemic and the impact on the businesses, but by not saying something in the letter, I think it\u2019s just a way to try and avoid saying something that could be perceived as a political statement, which he\u2019s been less willing to do in recent years,\u201d Shanahan said.\nA representative for Buffett didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment placed outside routine office hours.\nBuffett also stayed quiet on topics that are key to his conglomerate, such as the market environment amid a tumultuous year -- and the work of key investing deputies like Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, according to Cole Smead, whose Smead Capital Management oversees investments in Berkshire.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more found by what\u2019s not in the letter,\u201d said Smead, the firm\u2019s president and portfolio manager. \u201cI think just time and time again in this letter were sins of omission.\u201d\nHere are other key takeaways from Buffett\u2019s letter and Berkshire\u2019s annual report:\n1. Buffett Relies on Buybacks Instead of Deals\nBerkshire repurchased a record $24.7 billion of its own stock as Buffett struggled to find better ways to invest his enormous pile of cash.\nAnd there\u2019s more where that came from: The conglomerate has continued to buy its own stock since the end of last year, and is likely to keep at it, Buffett said Saturday in his annual letter.\n\u201cThat action increased your ownership in all of Berkshire\u2019s businesses by 5.2% without requiring you to so much as touch your wallet,\u201d Buffett said in the letter, which pointed out that the company \u201cmade no sizable acquisitions\u201d in 2020.\nBerkshire did make a small amount of progress in paring the cash pile, which fell 5% in the fourth quarter to $138.3 billion. Buffett has struggled to keep pace with the flow in recent years as Berkshire threw off cash faster than he could find higher-returning assets to snap up, leading to the surge in share repurchases.\n2. Apple Is as Valuable to Berkshire as BNSF Railroad\nBerkshire\u2019s $120 billion investment in Apple Inc. stock has become so valuable that Buffett places it in the same category as the sprawling railroad business he spent a decade building.\nHe began building a stake in the iPhone maker in 2016, and spent just $31.1 billion acquiring it all. The surge in value since then places it among the company\u2019s top three assets, alongside his insurers and BNSF, the U.S. railroad purchase completed in 2010, according to the annual letter.\n\u201cIn certain respects, it\u2019s his kind of business,\u201d said James Armstrong, who manages assets including Berkshire shares as president of Henry H. Armstrong Associates. \u201cIt\u2019s very much brand name, it\u2019s global, it\u2019s an absolutely addictive product.\u201d\nBuffett had always balked at technology investments, saying he didn\u2019t understand the companies well enough. But the rise of deputies including Combs and Weschler has brought Berkshire deep into the sector. In addition to Apple, the conglomerate has built up stakes in Amazon.com Inc., cloud-computing company Snowflake Inc., and Verizon Communications Inc.\n3. Buffett Concedes Error in $37.2 Billion Deal\nBuffett admitted he made a mistake when he bought Precision Castparts Corp. five years ago for $37.2 billion.\n\u201cI paid too much for the company,\u201d the billionaire investor said Saturday in his annual letter. \u201cNo one misled me in any way -- I was simply too optimistic about PCC\u2019s normalized profit potential.\u201d\nBerkshire took an almost $11 billion writedown last year that was largely tied to Precision Castparts, the maker of equipment for aerospace and energy industries based in Portland, Oregon.\nThe pandemic was the main culprit. Precision Castparts struggled as demand for flights plummeted, prompting airlines to park their jets and slash their schedules. Less flying means lower demand for replacement parts and new aircraft. Precision slashed its workforce by about 40% last year, according to Berkshire\u2019s annual report.\n4. Profit Gains Thanks to Railroad, Manufacturers\nDespite the pandemic\u2019s effects continuing to hit Berkshire\u2019s collection of businesses, the conglomerate posted a near 14% gain in operating earnings in the fourth quarter compared to the same period a year earlier.\nThat was helped by a record quarter for railroad BNSF since its 2010 purchase and one of the best quarters for the manufacturing operations since mid-2019.\n5. Good-bye Omaha, Hello Los Angeles\nBerkshire\u2019s annual meeting has for years drawn throngs of Buffett fans to Omaha, Nebraska, where the conglomerate is based. This year, the show is moving to the West Coast.\nWhile still virtual because of the pandemic, the annual meeting will be filmed in Los Angeles, the company said Saturday.\nThat will bring the event closer to the home of Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, Charlie Munger. Buffett and Munger will be joined by two key deputies, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who will also field questions.\nBuffett and Abel, who lives closer to Berkshire\u2019s headquarters, last year faced \u201ca dark arena, 18,000 empty seats and a camera\u201d at the annual meeting, Buffett said in his letter. The 90-year-old billionaire said he expects to do an in-person meeting in 2022.","52":"The week that was saw a marked shift in investor\u2019s problems from the NSE shutting down for hours to wild swings in all financial markets. US crossed the dubious half million-Covid-19 deaths mark with newer strains surging across other nations and governments racing to vaccinate their vulnerable population.\nWhile Gold was relatively muted, Equities saw straight days or 100 bps plus losses and Bond markets gave a thumb down to rates and inflation expectations worldwide. The risk in India was amplified in the absence of core domestic investor support and say 10 yr. Gsec yields hitting 6.20% and beyond. The long and short of it was gloom and doom with retail securities scurrying for cover.\nThe silver lining was that the long-suffering Mid-market segments saw a vote of confidence without paring losses. Commodities continued an upward trend with the CRB Index delivering 13.5% in USD terms since the beginning of the year. Countries like Israel successfully vaccinated large portions of the population with India also hitting the ground and generating significant goodwill by shipping Indian-made (albeit contract manufactured) ones far and wide, allaying to an extent global recovery fear.\nWith real assets like REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts largely Office rental yields) and some InVits also sowing a marked yield correction, the big ask for investors is whether to stick to existing allocations or readjust (tactical or strategic) distributions.\nIn a Business Insider article, market participants like UBS\u2019s chief investment officer of global wealth management, Mark Haefele are quoted as saying investors should brace for a near-term spike in inflation but concerns about a long-term rise are overblown while others like Bank of America are talking about a difficult but doable balance between short term inflation without the Fed tightening. Which presents an opportunity in the short term? If there is an over reaction in the markets, as also pointed out by the RBI Governor in an interview on TV last week (and I am paraphrasing here), then for smart money, this is an opportunity to rebalance their portfolios to take advantage of the volatility. Ideally, this would be profit booking in some asset classes and buying in those which have cracked.\nOn the other hand, this also allows those with equity overweight portfolios to start with a proper diversification strategy i.e. Just spreading risk over geographies is probably a poor risk management strategy at an overall portfolio level as those are subjected to both decaying and spiking correlations - neither of which portend well for the longer term.\nThe other observation has been the final nail in the coffin of 60\/40. With Debt Equity correlations spiking for the nth time in the last decade, a pure Debt plus Equity portfolio will see significant mark to market dip as the supposed hedge against stock market falls also crashes.\nThe proof of this has been \u201cBalanced Funds\u201d not finding favour with distribution or community both on account of waning investor interest and rejigged commission structure. Instead, there have been attempts by Asset Managers to cobble together shrink wrapped one-size-fits-all actively managed asset allocation products (which are diversified across geographies as well as asset classes to replace the balanced fund.\nIn my opinion, these are not likely to be risk-parity portfolios but may be suitable for those looking at experimenting with multi asset investments. As always, it is advisable to do one\u2019s own research before investing or seek assistance from a qualified, experienced, and licensed professional.","53":"Indian equity markets posted second weekly loss amidst weak global cues. Nifty\/Sensex lost -3.0%\/-3.5% to close at 14,529\/49,100. The broader market however, outperformed with both Nifty Midcap100 \/ Smallcap100 gaining +0.6%\/+0.9%.\nMajority of the sectors ended in red with IT being the biggest loser, down -4.7%. It was followed by Financials, auto, Pharma and Media which lost 3-4% while FMCG and Banks lost 2.5-3%. On the other hand, Metals was the clear winner with gains of 7.6%, on the back of rally in commodity prices fuelled by hopes of a recovery in demand. Energy and Realty ended with mild gains of 0.5%. FIIs turned net sellers for the week, having sold equities to the tune of Rs 11,300 crore (adjusted for Bosch deal), while DIIs were net buyers to the tune of Rs 300 crore.\nGlobal cues were weak as panic in global bond markets led to sharp rise in yields which spooked investors amid fears of interest rate cycle reversal and chances of sell-off in other asset classes too. US treasury yields leaped to their highest since the pandemic began, leading to steep fall in global markets. This was seen despite US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s statement that the policy rates could remain low for years.\nOn the domestic side, huge volatility was witnessed this week with market witnessing sharp rally for two days post NSE\u2019s longest-ever outage on Wednesday. It rallied almost 3% on Wednesday (post trade resumption) and Thursday put together to only witness sharp selloff of 4% on Friday. The first day of the March F&O series traded in deep red and the session ended with huge losses of more than 500 points.\nRising bond yields, geopolitical tensions and concerns over inflation have piled pressure on the market. However on the positive side, approval of PLIs in certain sectors along with FM Nirmala Sitharaman's statement that the Embargo has been lifted on grant of Government business to private banks, cheered the markets. Moody's also raised its growth projections for India, saying the economy is expected to clock a growth of 13.7% in FY22 on the back of the normalisation of activity and rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines.\nTechnically, Nifty formed a strong Bearish candle on daily scale indicating bears had complete grip on the market throughout the day. It formed a Bearish Island Reversal Gap pattern on daily time frame with gap up and gap down near to 15008-15065 zones in last two sessions. Now till it remains below 14650, weakness could be seen towards 14400-14300 zones while on the upside, hurdles are seen at 14750-14850 zones. India VIX moved up sharply this week to 28.14. Surge in VIX has given tight grip to Bears and is likely to put pressure on the market at any bounce.\nGoing ahead, the market may continue with its consolidation given weak global cues. Investors would closely track bond yields, geopolitical tensions and inflation data for further market direction and would monitor developments around new US stimulus announcement. Market would react to India\u2019s Q3FY21 GDP data on Monday, while on the economic calendar front, PMI data across few countries including India would also be eyed upon. High valuations does not provide much comfort and thus correction was long overdue. Investors should take this opportunity to buy on dips while traders should trade cautiously with stock specific action and book profits in regular intervals.\n(The writer is Head, Retail Research, B&D, MOFSL)","54":"Megastar Amitabh Bachchan has shared that he has a \"medical condition\" for which he needs to undergo surgery.\nIt is unclear if the medical procedure is complete.\nIn a one-line, cryptic message on his personal blog, the 78-year-old actor gave an update to his fans and followers.\n\"medical condition .. surgery .. can't write (sic)\" Amitabh Bachchan wrote on Saturday.\nThe actor recently shared the details about the projects his family members -- wife Jaya Bachchan, son Abhishek Bachchan and daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan -- were currently working on.\nAmitabh Bachchan had also said he would soon start shooting for filmmaker Vikas Bahl's next.\nThe screen icon was last seen in Shoojit Sircar's Gulabo Sitabo, which had a digital premiere last year in the wake of the coronavirus-induced shutdown.\nOne of the busiest stars in the Hindi film industry, Amitabh Bachchan was recently shooting for MayDay, directed by and starring Ajay Devgan.\nThe veteran actor, who regularly keeps in touch with his followers whom he calls his 'extended family' via social media, was also one of the first Indian film personalities to be diagnosed with coronavirus last year.\nAmitabh Bachchan, along with Abhishek Bachchan, 45, and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, 47, had tested positive for Covid-19 in July 2020.

","55":"In November, production began in Los Angeles on a new series with the trappings of a potential hit.\n\u201cUnwanted\u201d is a buddy action comedy told with a wink, part \u201cBeverly Hills Cop\u201d homage and part Seth Rogen-esque genre sendup. It stars Lamorne Morris (\u201cWoke\u201d and \u201cNew Girl\u201d) and Billy Magnussen (\u201cGame Night\u201d) as slackers who stumble on criminal intrigue in between bong hits, and its script is stocked with gross-out humor. (Sample line: \u201cWhen I told you I dropped my phone in the toilet, that wasn\u2019t the whole story.\u201d)\nBut 'Unwanted' is not the latest Netflix comedy; it\u2019s a podcast \u2014 or at least is starting out that way. The show\u2019s first two episodes were released this week by QCode Media, a 2-year-old company whose podcasts, with big names and high production values, are all but audio pitches for film and television. In July, for example, QCode introduced \u201cDirty Diana,\u201d an erotic drama starring Demi Moore; by September, Amazon made a deal to turn it into a TV series.\nA frothy adaptation market in Hollywood is just one sign of the rapid evolution of podcasting. Though the format dates to the early 2000s \u2014 it is named after the iPod \u2014 podcasting has had an expansive growth spurt the last few years. Since 2018, the number of available shows has more than tripled, to around 2 million. Spotify, Amazon, SiriusXM, iHeartMedia and other major streaming and traditional media companies have poured about $2 billion into the industry, both chasing and fueling its growth. Celebrities, even former presidents like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, are piling in, looking at on-demand audio as a key brand-building channel.\nOnce seen as a marginal forum for comedy, tech talk and public radio programming, podcasting is one of the hottest corners in media. Yet its formats and business practices are still developing, leading producers, executives and talent to view the medium as akin to television circa 1949: lucrative and uncharted territory with plenty of room for experimentation and flag-planting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new frontier, and we love it,\u201d said Morris, who is also a creator and executive producer of \u201cUnwanted.\u201d\nBut along with the optimism come worries that big money may stifle the DIY spirit vital to podcasting\u2019s identity. Indie podcasters, used to an open and decentralized distribution system, fear being marginalized if the tech giants push through pay walls and exclusive deals. And as podcasting becomes big business, there is unease that the diversity of voices in our earbuds \u2014 never a strong suit of the industry \u2014 could be put at risk too.\nNick Quah, who writes the Hot Pod newsletter, said that corporate interests tend to run contrary to what has always made podcasting interesting: the idea that anyone, anywhere, can bubble up and find an audience.\n\u201cAs we move forward and more of these platforms assume a stronger gatekeeping position,\u201d Quah said, \u201cthere\u2019s a strong possibility for new voices to get pushed out of the space. That\u2019s a real concern.\u201d\nCracking the Code of the Podcast Adaptation\nFor the average listener, the most noticeable change in podcasting\u2019s immediate future may simply be higher-quality shows.\nThe influx of money \u2014 from tech platforms, advertisers and Hollywood \u2014 has attracted talent and driven spending on production resources. Podcasting executives say they are now flooded with pitches for new shows, often from A-list writers, directors and performers.\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing now is this incredible flowering of creativity,\u201d said Lydia Polgreen, a former HuffPost and New York Times editor who is now managing director of Gimlet Media, a Spotify-owned studio.\nFor Hollywood, the podcasting space has become a farm team for intellectual property \u2014 where storylines can be tested out and promising material scooped up relatively cheaply. And with the movie business dominated by remakes, superhero franchises and other tent-pole mega-productions, the freedom podcasting provides is also refreshing, said Rob Herting, a former agent at the Creative Artists Agency who founded QCode.\n\u201cI had gotten tired of the repurposing of old intellectual property,\u201d Herting said. \u201cI kind of yearn for original stories. This felt like such a great outlet for those, a place where you can go to be bold, experiment and move quickly.\u201d\nQCode launched in early 2019 with \u201cBlackout,\u201d starring Rami Malek as a radio DJ in a small New England town when the national power grid mysteriously goes dark. The company now has a portfolio of 11 series, including \u201cHank the Cow Dog,\u201d a children\u2019s show with Matthew McConaughey, and \u201cCarrier,\u201d a thriller starring Cynthia Erivo that showcases another feature of many of the best podcasts: intense, consuming sound design. QCode plans 15 new podcasts in 2021.\nModest budgets and quick turnaround time enable more risk-taking. Most of QCode\u2019s shows cost in the low to mid six figures to make, Herting said \u2014 orders of magnitude less than a film or TV project \u2014 and an eight-episode podcast can be taped in just a week or two. A comparable TV season, Morris said, could take two months to shoot.\n \u201cUnwanted\u201d is the studio\u2019s first comedy, and Morris, who had a part in \u201cCarrier,\u201d said he was unsure whether it would work. For one thing, taping during the pandemic meant working remotely; using audio gear shipped to them at home, actors communicated via Zoom.\nBut Morris said that his worries evaporated the first day on the virtual set. His character, Ben, is introduced pleading for an extension on his student loan, before he is revealed to be calling from a strip club. In the background, comedian Ron Funches announces the dancers like a lascivious carnival barker: \u201cPut your hands together for the beautiful \u2026 Desssstiny!\u201d\n\u201cI heard the raw playback and I was dying laughing,\u201d Morris recalled. \u201cYou forget how immersive audio can be until you sit down and just plug in,\u201d he added. \u201cIt really takes you there.\u201d\n A successful adaptation into film or television can generate $1 million or more for podcast creators, far exceeding what most shows can collect from advertising. (The entire ad market for podcasts was estimated to be less than $1 billion last year, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau.)\nBut as the audience for podcasts grows \u2014 at least 104 million Americans listen each month, according to a survey last year by Edison Research and Triton Digital \u2014 TV and film properties are increasingly being adapted into audio shows as well.\n\u201cIt really is a two-way street,\u201d said Josh Lindgren, a podcast agent at CAA. \u201cIt\u2019s not just that Hollywood is coming to gobble up all the podcast IP and turn it into TV shows.\u201d\n Warner Bros. is creating podcasts for Spotify based on DC Comics characters; Marvel is bringing a slate of podcasts, including a scripted series, \u201cMarvel\u2019s Wastelanders,\u201d to SiriusXM. And Ben Silverman, the TV producer behind the American version of \u201cThe Office,\u201d whose company Propagate Content made an oral history of that show for Spotify, has struck a new deal with SiriusXM that will establish a new franchise of entertainment oral history podcasts.\n\u201cThere are no rules anymore,\u201d Silverman said. \u201cIf you are a creative person, you can go anywhere.\u201d\n Walled Gardens and the Future of Indies\nHollywood deals have taken podcasting far from its shoestring origins. But the growth story has been building for years.\nThe first mainstream hit arrived in 2014 with \u201cSerial,\u201d an investigative look at the murder of a teenage girl that was made by veteran public-radio journalists. The show \u2014 and the media attention it received \u2014 demonstrated the format\u2019s storytelling and marketing potential.\nNew stars were minted. Leon Neyfakh was a Slate staff writer in 2017 when he hosted the first season of \u201cSlow Burn,\u201d a meticulous examination of the Watergate scandal.\nAs a writer, Neyfakh said, he was dispirited to find that long feature stories, which had taken months of work, would yield just a few minutes of \u201caverage engaged time\u201d from readers. But \u201cSlow Burn\u201d fans would spend hours with the show, listening through to the end of episodes that lasted 30, 40 minutes or more.\n\u201cPeople are just willing to give you more of their attention in podcasting than they are in print,\u201d Neyfakh said.\nEpix turned the Watergate season of \u201cSlow Burn\u201d into a TV documentary and an anthology series starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn is heading to Starz. (Neyfakh\u2019s current history podcast is \u201cFiasco,\u201d which is also being adapted for television.)\nAlong with high-minded journalism came a flood of comedian-led talk shows, pop-culture gabfests, sex and self-help shows, and every niche dive imaginable. In 2017, Emily Cross, an indie-rock musician, was joking with a friend about the glut of podcasts when she hit on a \u201cSeinfeld\u201d-inspired idea.\n\u201cWhat if I just did a podcast about nothing? A podcast about just what I\u2019m looking at,\u201d Cross recalled. \u201cI was like: Actually, I really like that idea. So I just started doing it.\u201d\nFor 20 to 30 minutes each week, \u201cWhat I\u2019m Looking At\u201d features Cross calmly describing random objects \u2014 her shoes, an apple, a box of toothpicks \u2014 in soothing detail, like a combination Zen relaxation ritual and conceptual art project. She earns no money from it directly (she has supporters on Patreon), but has built a small community of followers who email her comments after every episode.\nShows like \u201cSlow Burn\u201d and \u201cWhat I\u2019m Looking At\u201d exemplify the power and charm of podcasting \u2014 an intimate, technologically simple medium that can help forge a connection with an audience over any topic, weighty or whimsical.\nThat power, and the lure of greater advertising dollars, has begun to draw big investment. In 2018, iHeartMedia, the broadcast radio giant, paid $55 million for Stuff Media, the studio behind hits like \u201cStuff You Should Know.\u201d Last year, SiriusXM acquired Stitcher, a popular app and distributor, for at least $265 million. And in late December, Amazon agreed to buy Wondery (\u201cDr. Death,\u201d \u201cDirty John\u201d) at a price estimated at more than $300 million.\nOver the last two years, Spotify has paid more than $800 million for a series of podcasting companies, like Gimlet, the Ringer and Anchor. Spotify has also struck content deals with the Obamas, Kim Kardashian West, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and comedian Joe Rogan, whose no-holds-barred talk \u2014 including with guests like Alex Jones \u2014 has made him podcasting\u2019s closest thing to Howard Stern.\nSpending has amped up competition among platforms, many of which have begun to protect their investments by keeping content inside so-called walled gardens, accessible only to subscribers. Spotify, which keeps some shows within its walls, has made it clear that it views podcasts as a way to attract new customers to its service. This month, Spotify said that a quarter of its 345 million customers listen to podcasts.\n\u201cThere is no question that podcasting is helping drive more people to Spotify than ever before,\u201d said Dawn Ostroff, the company\u2019s chief content and advertising business officer. \u201cThat\u2019s really our goal at this point.\u201d\n Consumers have grown accustomed to content arms races among streaming services like Netflix and Disney+. But in podcasting, it has led to fears of corporate Balkanization of what has long been a platform-neutral medium, in which anything but the most high-profile shows could effectively be suppressed.\nFor now, there are signs of experimentation in the distribution model \u2014 or at least a hesitancy by platforms to wall off too much of their content. When \u201cThe Michelle Obama Podcast\u201d came out in July, for example, it was only on Spotify, but within two months it was widely available, including on Spotify\u2019s archrival, Apple.\nSiriusXM, which owns Pandora and Stitcher, has developed a hybrid approach to take advantage of the offerings on each of those three brands. The company circulates free podcast versions of some of its subscriber-only radio shows, like Kevin Hart\u2019s \u201cComedy Gold Minds,\u201d to Pandora and Stitcher, in part as marketing for SiriusXM\u2019s paid service.\n\u201cWe love our three-barrel attack,\u201d said Scott Greenstein, SiriusXM\u2019s president and chief content officer.\n A Diversity Downside?\nLory Martinez, a Colombian American podcaster, keeps her grandfather\u2019s press card at her desk in Paris.\nHe was a newspaper reporter in Colombia who covered the country\u2019s Indigenous communities, and saw his role as bringing those people\u2019s stories and perspectives to the entire nation. His approach inspired the mission of Martinez\u2019s company, Studio Ochenta: \u201cRaising voices across cultures.\u201d\nOchenta began a year and a half ago with \u201cMija,\u201d a short-form podcast about the life of an immigrant daughter from Queens \u2014 modeled after Martinez herself \u2014 that was released in English, Spanish and French. It reached No. 1 on iTunes\u2019s fiction podcast charts in 13 countries, and its third season, about an Egyptian Muslim character in Britain and the United States, will be released in April in English, Spanish and Arabic.\n\u201cThere is now more of a space for voices than you would traditionally hear, and they are appearing in podcasting,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not only making podcasts, they are starting companies. That\u2019s what\u2019s so exciting about this time.\u201d\nBut Martinez said that starting her own company may have been the only way to get her shows \u2014 and her multilingual, multicultural approach \u2014 to market.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think \u2018Mija\u2019 would have been made if I pitched it elsewhere,\u201d Martinez said.\nIncreasing corporatization, and the incentive for platforms to favor the shows they own, has intensified concerns that podcasts from underrepresented groups could enjoy less promotion, find fewer listeners and collect less advertising revenue \u2014 a vicious cycle that would repeat many of the failings of the old media model.\nFor all the rah-rah talk of podcasts as a democratized medium, building diversity has been a slow undertaking. In 2008, for example, 73% of monthly listeners in the United States were white. In those days, \u201cthe average podcast you listened to was two white dudes talking about internet routers, and the audience reflected that,\u201d said Tom Webster of Edison Research.\nLast year, Edison and Triton found that white listeners\u2019 slice of the pie had narrowed to 63%, nearly mirroring the 60% of Americans who identify as white in census data. But the representation behind the microphone still lags.\nJuleyka Lantigua-Williams, a former journalist at NPR and The Atlantic who founded a production company focused on work by people of color, said that media and tech companies should look at diversity as a business imperative, given the country\u2019s shifting demographics and the devoted audiences that companies like Studio Ochenta are building.\n\u201cIn the rush to secure the players that look like sure bets,\u201d Lantigua-Williams said, \u201cthey are overlooking the creators who are really growing audiences that are going to stay with them five, 10 years down the line.\u201d\n Yet some podcasters have found success navigating the corporate world from within. Spotify\u2019s \u201cDope Labs\u201d features two young Black women, Titi Shodiya and Zakiya Whatley \u2014 both working scientists with Ph.D.s \u2014 who came to podcasting via a Spotify-sponsored accelerator program, Sound Up, that aims to bring talent from underrepresented groups into the medium.\n\u201cDope Labs\u201d mingles hard-nosed science and pop culture, with episodes on coronavirus vaccinations, racism in science and the history of Afrofuturism. The show has more than 100,000 followers \u2014 a midlevel hit.\n\u201cPeople have this stereotypical box of what a scientist looks like, what they sound like and what they care about,\u201d Shodiya said. \u201cAnd we say, no. We don\u2019t only care about these things. We\u2019re really into fashion. We\u2019re really into music. We\u2019re really into food. We like to break the mold.\u201d\nSound Up awarded Shodiya and Whatley $10,000 and offered them training in basics like interviewing and using recording equipment. They were free to take their show anywhere, and Shodiya said they pitched it to other companies, which asked for changes the women did not want to make. They stuck with Spotify.\n\u201cSpotify seemed to get it,\u201d Shodiya said. \u201cThey really appreciate our voices and what we bring to the platform.\u201d\n Opportunities for Creativity\nFor a star like Morris, the question of access to media is less of an issue. But even for him, podcasts offer a rare opportunity \u2014 to test a new idea, quickly and cheaply.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re a creative person, you need an outlet,\u201d Morris said. \u201cYou can\u2019t always say, \u2018Let\u2019s go and make a $50 million movie.\u2019 But you can sit down, record, say your idea out loud.\u201d\nFor now, many podcasters say, the money spent by platforms, media companies and advertisers has helped enable experimentation in the format and a sharpening of storytelling techniques.\nEarly fiction hits like Gimlet\u2019s \u201cHomecoming,\u201d from 2016, about a therapist working with returning soldiers, demonstrated some of the potential for innovation, with crosscut scenes and varying audio treatment of voices to indicate different environments \u2014 a high-tech take on techniques first heard in 1930s radio dramas. (\u201cHomecoming\u201d became a TV series on Amazon starring Roberts and then Janelle Mon\u00e1e.)\nMore recently, shows like Audible\u2019s \u201cWhen You Finish Saving the World,\u201d a five-hour drama by Jesse Eisenberg, have tinkered further with narration and storytelling in long-form audio.\n\u201cUnwanted,\u201d Morris said, could very well be a film or television project. (A spokesperson for QCode said no negotiations to adapt it have taken place yet.) The story, he said, was just one of \u201cmillions\u201d of ideas that he and Kyle Shevrin, his co-creator and writing partner, have bandied about, and podcasting allowed it to become a reality.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a proof of concept,\u201d Morris said, \u201cto say to the industry: This works, this is fun, this is something that can be done.\u201d","56":"When the 78th annual Golden Globes are handed out Sunday, they will be the first major awards show of the season, coming nearly two months after we would typically find out the best picture winner.\nRather than the Globes\u2019 usual Beverly Hills gala, this year\u2019s event will be a hybrid affair, with Saturday Night Live alumnae Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosting from opposite coasts: Fey will appear live from the Rainbow Room in New York; Poehler from the Beverly Hilton, the awards\u2019 usual West Coast home.

The official Golden Globe Awards preshow begins streaming live from the official @GoldenGlobes Twitter account and on the website at 6:30 pm Eastern, 3:30 Pacific. And the network broadcasting the ceremony, NBC, also has a preshow; with Jane Lynch and Susan Kelechi Watson as hosts, it starts at 7 pm Eastern, 4 pm Pacific.\nWill there be a red carpet?\nNo. But, on television, E!\u2019s pre-show coverage will feature nominee interviews and red-carpet throwbacks.\nWhere can you watch the ceremony?\nOn television, NBC is the official broadcaster. Online, if you have a cable login, you can watch via NBC.com\/live. Depending on where you live, there\u2019s also Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, AT&T TV Now, YouTube TV or FuboTV, which all require subscriptions, though many are offering free trials.\nJust what are the Globes anyway?\nThe 25 film and television awards are presented by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 journalists mainly known for this ceremony. There\u2019s no overlap with the more than 9,000 Academy Awards voters, but because of the timing (Oscar nominations this year fall on March 15), the Globes can seem like they\u2019re influential.\nAlso read: Sacha Baron Cohen: Outrageous comedian with a serious point, and two Globes nods\nThe HFPA has been in the spotlight recently after a Los Angeles Times investigation highlighted the lack of Black voting members.

A New York Times report also found that the tax-exempt nonprofit paid more than $3 million in salaries and other compensation to members and staff.\nWhat should you watch for?\nNetflix once again dominated the nominations this year, garnering a whopping 42. Its films include David Fincher\u2019s Old Hollywood biopic, Mank, which picked up six nominations, and Aaron Sorkin\u2019s latest courtroom drama, The Trial of the Chicago 7, which got five. Hulu\u2019s Nomadland, which stars Frances McDormand, picked up four, and the film\u2019s director, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, could become the first woman of Asian descent to be honoured in a director category. Chadwick Boseman is also a favourite to be honoured posthumously for best actor for his final film role as a trumpeter in Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom. Jane Fonda will be given the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement, and Norman Lear will get the Carol Burnett Award for contributions to television.","57":"Hollywood's award season kicks off Sunday at a very different Golden Globes, with a mainly virtual ceremony set to boost or dash the Oscars hopes of early frontrunners like \"Nomadland\" and \"The Trial of the Chicago 7.\"\nUsually a star-packed, laid-back party that draws Tinseltown's biggest names to a Beverly Hills hotel ballroom, this pandemic edition will be broadcast from two scaled-down venues in California and New York, with frontline and essential workers among the few in attendance.\nDeprived of its usual glamour, the Globes -- which also honor the best in television -- remain a coveted prize, and a high-profile source of momentum in the run-up to the season-crowning Oscars, which were pushed back this year to April.\n\"Nomadland,\" Chloe Zhao's paean to a marginalized, older generation of Americans roaming the West in rundown vans, has long been viewed as a frontrunner for the Globes' top prize.\nBut it will face stiff competition from Aaron Sorkin's \"Chicago 7,\" a courtroom drama about the city's anti-war riots in 1968 with a mouth-watering ensemble cast including Mark Rylance, Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen.\nBoth films are fueled by their timely themes of protest and joblessness.\n\"I think that it's likeliest between them,\" said The Hollywood Reporter's awards columnist Scott Feinberg.\n\"And then the spoiler, if something were to come out of left field, would probably be 'Promising Young Woman,' which is just unlike anything else in recent memory.\"\nIts star Carey Mulligan -- playing a revenge-seeker who lurks at bars, feigning drunkenness to lure men into revealing their own misogyny -- is tipped by many to win best actress.\nShe will have to fend off Frances McDormand's grounded and nuanced turn alongside a cast of non-actors in \"Nomadland,\" and Viola Davis' portrayal of a legendary 1920s crooner in \"Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.\"\nThe other films vying for best drama, the night's final and most prestigious prize, are \"Mank\" -- David Fincher's ode to \"Citizen Kane,\" which topped the overall nominations with six -- and \"The Father\" starring Anthony Hopkins.\nHopkins, who has never won a competitive Globe despite seven previous nominations, has been showered with praise for his harrowing portrayal of the onset of dementia.\nBut he is up against sentimental favorite Chadwick Boseman, the \"Black Panther\" star who died last August from cancer at age 43.\nBoseman is nominated for his kinetic performance as a tragic young trumpet player opposite Davis in \"Ma Rainey.\"\n\"This is his best part, and the backstory is that he knew this might be his last performance -- so that's kind of hard to resist,\" said Variety awards editor Tim Gray.\nThe race will be closely watched by groups including Time's Up, which this week slammed the Globes-awarding Hollywood Foreign Press Association for failing to admit a single Black member.\n\"Old news.

Representatives of the Princely State of Mysore, ruled by the Wadiyars, and officials of the British government of Madras Presidency sit down at a conference in Ooty to discuss sharing of the Cauvery water. \nA conflict over the Cauvery river water had already emerged, with Mysore wanting to make use of surplus water flowing into the sea for irrigation and the Madras Presidency fearing that such a move would curtail water flowing into its territory. Two years later, the contending parties arrive at an agreement \u2014 no new irrigation works would be taken up by Mysore without prior consultation with the Madras Presidency. \nRead | River linking project: Karnataka fears Tamil Nadu may eye surplus Cauvery water\nMore than a century later, the Cauvery continues to be a bone of contention between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. \nIn a fresh tribulation for Karnataka, the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu recently inaugurated the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linking project which envisages diverting surplus water from the Cauvery, including the flood water, to parched areas in southern districts of Tamil Nadu like Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar. \nLegal battle\nFearing that its share of excess water will be encroached by the neighbouring state, Karnataka is now all set to wage a legal battle against\nthe project. \nOn Friday, Law Minister Basavaraj Bommai said Tamil Nadu\u2019s project was against the interests of Karnataka, pointing out that the issue of utilisation of surplus water was still pending before the Cauvery Water Dispute Tribunal and there was no legal decision in this regard. The proposed project is also against the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, he said. \nAlso Read | Forget ILR pipedream, let us pray for smaller places of worship\nTamil Nadu\u2019s inauguration of the project comes ahead of the assembly elections scheduled to be held on April 6. Karnataka\u2019s appeal to the Centre against the project comes even as the BJP is working hard to clinch electoral victory in Tamil Nadu. \nThe present contention of both governments pertains to water that flows into the sea, over and beyond their allocated share. In 2018, the Supreme Court directed Karnataka to supply 177.25 tmcftft (thousand million cubic feet) water annually to Tamil Nadu, as against the 192 tmcft earlier allocated by the Cauvery Water Disputes Tribunal. \nAccordingly, of the total 740 tmcft water estimated in the Cauvery basin, Karnataka\u2019s share is 284.75 tmcft, that of Tamil Nadu is 404.25 tmcft, Kerala (30 tmcft), Puducherry (7 tmcft). Of the rest, 10 tmcft has been set aside for environmental protection, while 4 tmcft is considered \u201cinevitable escapage\u201d into the sea. \nWhat has TN set out to do? \nTamil Nadu\u2019s project is part of the larger Peninsular Rivers\u2019 Development Component of the Centre, which proposes linking Mahanadi-Godavari-Krishna- Pennar-Cauvery-Vaigai and Gundar rivers, through inter-basin water transfer link canals. \nTamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami laid the foundation stone for the first phase of the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar linking project on February 21. \nThe linking will begin from the Kattalai Barrage, located about 138 km downstream of Mettur Dam. The link canal will be 261.45-km long and will carry about 6,000 cusecs of water.\nThe project will be implemented in three phases, with the first phase alone costing Rs 6,941 crore. Linking of Cauvery, Vaigai and Gundar has been a long-standing demand of farmers in parched districts in south Tamil Nadu.\n\u201cOnce the project is implemented, not only will lakes get filled but it will also recharge groundwater, ensuring fertility of land in barren areas. This project will change the face of southern districts that battle drought almost every year,\u201d G S Dhanapathy, state secretary, Farmers Forum of India, Pudukkottai, told DH.\nTamil Nadu PWD Secretary K Manivasan claimed that the state did not need Karnataka\u2019s consent for implementing the project. \u201cWe want to utilise excess water and flood water to recharge groundwater and provide drinking water. We are not increasing the area of cultivation. We are well within our rights to implement this project,\u201d he said.\nA Veerappan, Retired Chief Engineer of Tamil Nadu Public Works Department (PWD), says Karnataka cannot oppose the project but raises several questions over the implementation of the ambitious scheme.\n\u201cThe project certainly has several deficiencies and demerits. The water will travel in the open canal and the entire route comes under the drought-prone areas. Constructing an open canal would only lead to illegal pumping of water,\u201d he said.\nVeerappan pointed out that even the Telugu Ganga project, which aimed to provide water to Chennai from the Krishna river, had its problems. \nTamil Nadu receives just about 600 cusecs of water in the Kandaleru-Poondi canal at zero point, while the Andhra Pradesh Government releases about 2000 cusecs at Kandaleru Reservoir. \u201cA lot of water is being pumped out illegally in the Krishna canal. The same would happen here in Tamil Nadu,\u201d he added.\nKarnataka\u2019s concerns \nHowever, Karnataka fears that the project is an indirect attempt by the neighbouring state to establish its rights over excess water. The state government has written to the Centre stating that the only obligation of Karnataka as per the 2018 Supreme Court order was to ensure the release of 177.25 tmcft annually in a normal water year to Tamil Nadu. \u201cTherefore, Karnataka is entitled to all the surplus water available in its territory,\u201d it has said. \nMoreover, Karnataka too has plans for utilising the excess water for projects such as Mekedatu, Kabini Phase 2 and other lift irrigation projects. According to the government, the annual surplus water is 83 tmcft on an average, which can be used to cater to these projects.\n\u201cTamil Nadu can use the excess water generated in its catchment area. However, their proposal makes a generic mention that they want to make use of excess water from the Cauvery. Our fear is that the state will eventually lay claim to the surplus water in entirety,\u201d an official in the Water Resources Department said. \nFurther, if the Centre\u2019s river-linking project is implemented in full, both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka will get extra water channeled through the Pennar river. \u201cTamil Nadu can then link Vaigai and Gundar from the available extra water. Without implementation of the Centre\u2019s river-linking project, the neighbouring state is proposing to use the existing surplus water, which is not legally permissible,\u201d the official added. \nMissed opportunity \nMeanwhile, even as Karnataka\u2019s farmers and political leaders have opposed Tamil Nadu\u2019s project, there is also resentment about government apathy.\nK C Basavaraju, leader of \u2018Cauvery Kutumba\u2019, an association of farmers from both states seeking solution to the river conflict, said successive governments, whether it is the Congress, JD(S) or the BJP, had failed Kannadigas when it came to Cauvery.\nAlso Read | Tamil Nadu acting as if surplus Cauvery water belongs to them: Karnataka\n\u201cIn 2018, even though the apex Court increased Karnataka\u2019s water allocation, the state actually did not gain much. The Tribunal\u2019s verdict had permitted hydro power projects as long as the downstream release of water was consistent with its order. This would have been an opportunity for Karnataka to develop the Mekedatu project. However, Karnataka filed a special leave petition against the Tribunal\u2019s verdict, encouraged by Tamil Nadu, which did the same. The Supreme Court verdict of 2018 is silent on the hydro projects. Tamil Nadu is likely to use this to create impediments for Karnataka. Successive governments have been promising Mekedatu but have failed in taking it forward,\u201d he explained, adding that Karnataka was crying over spilt milk, all owing to official apathy.\n\u2018Both parties are ill-informed\u2019 \nPolitics aside, ecologists rubbish the arguments of both Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as ill-informed. Water activist S Vishwanath pointed out, \u201cThe dispute is political, arising from lack of clarity on using the surplus water. Chauvinistic arguments prevail while we are no longer looking at the river ecosystem, the livelihoods provisioning and health of the river. We are only looking at it as a unit to be traded between two states.\u201d\nVishwanath says the whole premise of the argument, that water reaching the sea was going waste, was ridiculous.\n\u201cWhen river water reaches the delta, it prevents salinity and protects the integrity of the biological ecosystem. Fresh water entering the sea brings with it nutrients, supporting biodiversity of the sea itself. This also helps the monsoon ecosystem to kick in, as fresh water is easier to evaporate than salt water,\u201d he added, lamenting political considerations overriding ecological concerns. \nAs of now, Karnataka has no choice but to wait for the Centre\u2019s response to its objections, while it simultaneously prepares for a legal battle. ","71":"Consider some basic facts: A specialised agency, National Water Development Agency (NWDA), was set up four decades ago to work only on Inter Linking of Rivers (ILR) projects, but even the first project of the grand ILR plan is yet to take off to implementation as envisaged in ILR plan.\nIn fact, NWDA is not confident of putting any of the thousands of reports produced by it in public domain, it knows they won\u2019t stand public scrutiny.\nThe Memorandum of Understanding for India\u2019s first ILR scheme, the Ken Betwa River Link\u2019s DPR (Detailed Project Report) was signed between Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh in 2005. But 16 years later, the project is yet to go to implementation stage, it does not even have all the clearances, nor a water or cost-benefit sharing agreement.\nRead | A fantasy of surplus water: Ahead of polls, Tamil Nadu cashes in on river linking project\nIn 2002, a Supreme Court of India bench headed by the then retiring Chief Justice ordered the Central Government to implement the ILR in 10 years, and bring a law to take care of inter-state issues if necessary.\nAlmost two decades later, even the first project is yet to go to implementation. In 2012, another Supreme Court bench also ordered that ILR be implemented in 10 years, that order is going to meet the same fate as the earlier one.\nNot feasible\nThese facts say a lot about the feasibility, optimality, viability or desirability of ILR plans. In fact, no state in India is as enthusiastic about ILR as Tamil Nadu, since Tamil Nadu only hopes to gain more water and does not have to give water to any state.\nThat enthusiasm which started with the hopes of getting water from far away Ganga, Brahmaputra, Mahanadi and Godavari has turned a mirage. And now it has led to turn the logic on its head and is hoping to make India\u2019s most celebrated deficit basin, the Cauvery basin, from an eternal recipient to a donor basin!\nSo how did Tamil Nadu achieve this remarkable somersault? Besides using previously unheard of 43% dependability figures, it completely ignores the seriously degraded state of the upstream catchment, where the rainfall is quickly turning into runoff and thus the dams in the Cauvery basin are filling up fast and early, giving a false sense that there is surplus water.\nThis is happening as the local water systems, wetlands, lakes, streams, forests and groundwater recharging mechanisms are getting destroyed in the catchment.\nThe increasing silt accumulation in the dams with each passing year (Krishnaraja Sagar and Mettur are getting old as they were commissioned 90 and 87 years ago respectively) is also reducing their storage capacity. So less of the rainfall is getting retained in the catchment and more is turning quickly into runoff, but that is not a good sign. Unfortunately, there is no assessment of this in any basin in India.\nThat brings us to surplus-deficit conclusions of ILR done by NWDA. It is only based on some assumptions about water use in existing and planned minor, medium and major irrigation in party states. The information base for this is seriously inadequate and flawed.\nRead | Land or water, illegal structures built everywhere: BBMP finds 277 illegal structures built over waterbodies\nThe water balance does not take into account the rainwater harvesting, local water systems, catchment, soil moisture, watershed, state of the streams and rivers or groundwater recharge assessments.\nNo scientific basis \nIn short, we do not even have any scientific basis to arrive at surplus-deficit conclusion for any river basin since we have not done basin level assessment of potential of all the water options in any basin starting from watershed upwards.\nThe celebrated argument that ILR will solve flood and drought problems across India is based on the assumption that flood means surplus and drought means deficit. It again has no scientific basis, since there are drought prone basins that also increasingly face floods and there are flood prone basins that also face serious water scarcity at other times.\nIn fact, groundwater is and has been India\u2019s water lifeline for at least last four decades, including for irrigation, rural and urban water supply and also for industrial water supply.\nThat water lifeline is in a very bad state with depleting levels and deteriorating quality, with complete absence of groundwater regulation or protection and rejuvenation of groundwater recharge mechanisms.\nReversing that situation has to be our top priority as that is where our real water solution is. \nILR is certainly a dream for the big dam lobby where contractor-driven big projects are the mainstay. The politicians have always loved such big projects due to the prevailing political economy. Sooner we understand this reality and move to reverse it, better it will be.\nDiscard the pipe dreams and pray for smaller places of worship.\n(The writer is with South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People)","72":"There have been widespread protests after skyrocketing fuel prices upset the common man\u2019s budget.

Food, if there is any, is stale bread and cold beans. A bed is the floor or a dirty carpet. The threat of death \u2014 screamed, shouted, sometimes inflicted \u2014 is ever-present.\nMalik Mohammadi, a calm 60-year-old farmer, watched the Taliban put to death his 32-year-old son Nasrullah, an army officer, in one such prison. Over a period of nine days last year, Nasrullah, an epileptic, was refused medicine by his captors. He was denied food. His father saw blood coming from his mouth, and bruises from beatings. On the 10th day, he died.\n\u201cThe Taliban beat him,\u201d Mohammadi said quietly. \u201cI watched the killing of my son.\u201d\nRead | At pivotal moment in Afghanistan war, Biden weighs a dilemma\nSuch repression is part of the Taliban\u2019s strategy of control in the territories under their rule. While the Afghan government and Taliban negotiators in Qatar fitfully talk about meeting for talks, even as the idea of real peace recedes, the reality is that the insurgents already hold much of the country. An approaching U.S. withdrawal, coupled with a weak Afghan security force, means the group is likely to maintain this authority and its brutal ways of invoking submission.\nOne of the Taliban\u2019s most fearsome tools for doing so is a loose network of prisons, an improvised archipelago of mistreatment and suffering, in which the insurgents inflict harsh summary judgment on their fellow Afghans, arbitrarily stopping them on the highway. Mostly, they are looking for soldiers and government workers.\n\u201cIt keeps coming back to me in my sleep,\u201d said Sayed Hiatullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Faizabad. Last year, Hiatullah was falsely accused at a Taliban checkpoint of working for state security. He was imprisoned for 25 days.\n\u201cI wake up and scream,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the darkest, most bitter period in my life. I was in shock for six months,\u201d Hiatullah said.\nCapture is only the beginning of the torment. Local commanders, often very young, have unrestrained control over their prisoners.\n\u201cThe low-level Taliban members\u2019 behavior is very bad,\u201d said Fazul-Ahmad Aamaj, an elderly, semiofficial mediator in Faizabad.","74":"Robin Arnone, a part-time trainer before the coronavirus pandemic, hasn\u2019t set foot in the Colosseum Gym in Columbia, Maryland, since the virus shut it down almost a year ago. The gym is open again, but she doesn\u2019t need the work. Things are going gangbusters in her other job as a home appraiser, and she hasn\u2019t looked back.\nFor Julie Stark, one of Arnone\u2019s best friends and a professional dog walker, things are not so rosy. With many clients stuck at home in the pandemic and taking care of their own pets, her services are no longer in demand. Instead of walking seven dogs each day, she now walks three.\nStark has had to economize, eliminating dance and gymnastics classes for her children to save $350 a month. She doesn\u2019t know when her clients will want her back, but it\u2019s not something she discusses with Arnone. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about money,\u201d Stark said.\n\u201cIt would be awkward if she were a dog walker and doing unbelievably well,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m happy for her.\u201d\nAnd there is a lot in Arnone\u2019s life to be happy about. She replaced her used Lexus with a new one last year, and in December she indulged herself with a $550 Dyson hair dryer. \u201cIt felt a little ridiculous,\u201d she said of the purchase. \u201cBut I worked hard, and if there\u2019s any year I\u2019m going to do it, it\u2019s this year.\u201d\nArnone and Stark are among the millions of friends who were on a relatively equal financial footing before last March \u2014 people who would have thought nothing of splitting the check on a night out \u2014 and now find themselves on vastly different trajectories. Lockdowns changed what Americans can do as well as what services they need, and in the process created divergent fates for many workers.\nThe pandemic has wreaked havoc on many who were already struggling. Nearly 10 million fewer people have jobs, and some 26 million reported not always having enough to eat, according to Census Bureau data.\nFor the 50% or so of the population that makes up the middle class \u2014 defined by Pew Research Center as having an income ranging from around $45,000 to $135,000 for a household of three \u2014 the toll has been uneven. Like a tornado, the pandemic can devastate one household and leave neighboring ones unscathed.\nArnone\u2019s world, in the Washington-Baltimore area, exemplifies that. The gym where she worked, the Colosseum, is owned by her friend Tim Gallagher. His monthly income at the gym is down 25 to 30%, and a quarter of the gym\u2019s members have suspended their accounts. To save money, he has lowered the thermostat at home to 60 degrees from 65, and while his truck has more than 340,000 miles on it, he has no plans to replace it.\n\u201cYou just got to scrape along and gut it out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really struggling to get by.\u201d\nBut in Arnone\u2019s other field, home appraising, her friends and colleagues are reaping rewards from the booming housing market, where January sales were up 23.7% from a year earlier, according to the National Association of Realtors. Ultralow mortgage rates have prompted a wave of refinancings, which require fresh appraisals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much to complain about,\u201d said Traci Warner, a friend of Arnone\u2019s and a home appraiser in Waldorf, Maryland, south of Washington. After her husband was laid off from his sales job in April, Warner\u2019s work picked up the slack.\nIt\u2019s not that things are perfect, but unlike Gallagher, she does not feel that she is barely hanging on.\nThis contrast is mirrored in the larger economy. Weekly unemployment claims by newly laid-off workers remain at historically elevated levels even as stock indexes reach record highs.\nVaccines have arrived, but their slow rollout means it will be months before anything resembling normal activity can resume at restaurants, hotels, gyms, airports, malls and other businesses that depend on bringing people together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very uneven,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, a forecasting and research group. \u201cThe recovery for the most vulnerable parts of the population will take years.\u201d Not only are wages and salaries down for the hardest-hit segments of the workforce, he noted, but so are overall employment and participation in the labor force.\nAt the very top, the gains have been staggering. In eight months after the pandemic hit the United States, the wealth of the country\u2019s roughly 650 billionaires grew by $1 trillion, according to a November study by the Institute for Policy Studies and other progressive groups. That included a $70 billion lift for just one of those magnates: the founder of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.\nWhite-collar employees, having emerged mostly unscathed from the sharp downturn in 2020, are looking forward to what they hope will be a robust recovery in 2021 once most people are vaccinated. Service workers, devastated by the idling of entire industries amid lockdowns and other restrictions, just want the pain to abate.\nThe split was evident in the latest jobs report from the Labor Department. While professional and business services employment jumped by 97,000 in January, that job growth was almost entirely offset in the private sector by losses in the retail, leisure and hospitality industries, among others.\nSo while lines at food banks lengthen, new Teslas dot parking lots, and there are waiting lists for Peloton machines so the most fortunate can keep up with their workouts from home.\nPeter Atwater, a lecturer in economics at the College of William & Mary, has popularized a term for this phenomenon: the K-shaped recovery. While one arm of the K ascends, the other is driving lower. \u201cThere\u2019s an enormous divide in confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we buy and spend based on how we feel.\u201d\nJanet Yellen, the newly confirmed Treasury secretary, extended the metaphor during her confirmation hearings. \u201cWe are living in a K-shaped economy, one where wealth built upon wealth, while working families fell farther and farther behind,\u201d she said.\nLife on the Upside\nArnone misses her days at the gym, especially spending time with clients. It is the first time since she was 15 that she hasn\u2019t worked as a trainer, she said. But she is feeling pretty good otherwise.\nBefore the pandemic, she would train people in the morning and shift to her real estate work in the afternoon. Now she rises at 6 a.m. to start writing up appraisals before hitting the road to visit as many as eight homes in a day.\n\u201cI\u2019ve declined a boatload of appraisal jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t have the time.\u201d\nAfter typically handling 500 appraisals a year, she did 635 last year. She is paid by the banks that issue the mortgages, and last year, she estimates, she earned roughly $250,000 for her services, up from about $185,000 in previous years.\nShe lives in Woodbine, Maryland, 25 miles west of Baltimore, and although she still thinks of herself as middle class, she said her nieces told her she was upper middle class; she concedes that they\u2019re probably right.\nIt\u2019s a world away from the apartment where she grew up in Randallstown, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, as the child of a single mother. \u201cThinking back, I had no clue,\u201d Arnone said. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much we didn\u2019t have. If I wanted something, my mom would go without, but I didn\u2019t have the nicest clothes or the name brands.\u201d\nMaybe that\u2019s why she feels a little ashamed of her good fortune when she sees news stories about long lines at food banks or other evidence of the pandemic\u2019s economic woes. \u201cWhen I throw out the veggies I never got to eat, my mother\u2019s Catholic guilt weighs on me,\u201d she said.\n Home appraisal is a boom-and-bust business, driven by the housing market\u2019s cycles. But with interest rates near record lows, and new buyers shopping for houses while existing homeowners refinance, work is plentiful for now.\nWarner \u2014 Arnone\u2019s friend and fellow home appraiser \u2014 traded in her Honda Accord, which had more than 300,000 miles on it, for a 2017 BMW X3, not long ago, and was able to go to the beach in Delaware with her family last summer. This month, they went skiing in Virginia.\n\u201cOur finances are pretty good,\u201d added Warner, 51. \u201cThe market has been amazing.\u201d\nArnone, by her own description, is a worrywart and had done her training work on the side to supplement her income. Now she doesn\u2019t feel the need.\n\u201cThe gym was always my safe place, and it\u2019s weird not seeing Tim and other friends \u2014 I miss them,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I won\u2019t lie. It\u2019s nice to have more time and more flexibility.\u201d\nThe Long Wait for Normal\nA year ago, Stark felt things were going her way. Five years earlier, she started a business as a dog walker and pet sitter, after having been a veterinary technician. \u201cIt was perfect,\u201d she said, until the pandemic arrived.\nNow her clients are home and can walk their dogs themselves. And the decline in travel leaves little need for pet sitters. \u201cI\u2019m holding out hope that my clients will need me again,\u201d she said. She has been surviving with help from her parents, child support from her ex-husband and unemployment benefits.\nStark has her hands full with her own pets in the meantime. She has two rescue dogs, Roxy and Luke, as well as two cats. Everyone, she adds, gets along.\nShe did get one new client during the pandemic, but most of the so-called pandemic puppies adopted in the past 11 months are being walked by their owners or their children, she said. She isn\u2019t sure whether her old clients will come back when the pandemic recedes or she will be walking the new dogs.\nSometimes she thinks of returning to a 9-to-5 job outside the house. \u201cPart of me just wants a stable job and a regular paycheck,\u201d she said. It doesn\u2019t seem realistic, though: With her two daughters, ages 10 and 14, in school remotely, she needs to be at home most of the time. \u201cI\u2019m just hoping things will return to normal,\u201d she said.\nGovernment aid has been crucial for helping people like Stark and Gallagher weather the pandemic. And their reliance on it underscores why many economists believe more federal assistance is necessary, especially if the K-shaped recovery continues.\n\u201cPolitical leaders and policymakers have a big role to play in getting that bottom leg of the K up,\u201d Daco of Oxford Economics said. \u201cThey hold the key to a stronger labor-market recovery that is as inclusive as possible and will reduce the long-term damage to the economy.\u201d\nGallagher, the owner of the Colosseum Gym, recently applied for a second round of small-business loans. That, and forbearance from his landlord, should enable him to keep Colosseum open in the months ahead.\nStill, he is not expecting an imminent recovery. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to take till the end of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to operate at 50% of capacity. But I don\u2019t have to worry about 50% because everybody is scared to death to come in.\u201d\nThe warnings from Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, haven\u2019t helped business, Gallagher added. \u201cHis COVID briefings are deadly to my gym,\u201d he joked. \u201cEvery time he opens his mouth, another five or six people put their memberships on hold.\u201d\nIn the meantime, Gallagher\u2019s decisions reflect the continuing economic pain. He has laid off most of his part-time employees.\n Normally, he and his wife would go out several times a week, but now one outing is the limit. \u201cThat\u2019s a big splurge for us,\u201d he said. They have also dropped premium channels from their cable service.\nAt the gym, a popular gathering spot for hard-core weightlifters, the clanging of the machines has been replaced by background music and the whirring of the treadmills occupied by the most devoted exercisers.\nAnd public health officials have warned that high-intensity workout sessions at gyms can spread the coronavirus, potentially threatening Colosseum\u2019s revival.\n Gallagher said there was little personal training going on. Maybe five or six guests are out on the floor while Gallagher keeps himself busy cleaning up and fixing equipment. Every so often, he signs up a new member, with dues running at $59 a month.\nHe is confident that eventually \u2014 on the other side of the pandemic \u2014 people will want to come back to the gym.\nNot everyone, though. He is concerned that members who have fallen out of the gym habit may never return. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take longer to make up for those memberships and get other people to join,\u201d he said. \u201cA few people will never want to go to the gym, or the movies or where there are crowds of people. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d","75":"Officials at the Pompeii archaeological site in Italy announced Saturday the discovery of an intact ceremonial chariot, one of several important discoveries made in the same area outside the park near Naples following an investigation into an illegal dig.\nThe chariot, with its iron elements, bronze decorations and mineralized wooden remains, was found in the ruins of a settlement north of Pompeii, beyond the walls of the ancient city, parked in the portico of a stable where the remains of three horses previously were discovered.\nThe Archaeological Park of Pompeii called the chariot \u201can exceptional discovery\u201d and said \"it represents a unique find - which has no parallel in Italy thus far - in an excellent state of preservation.\u201d\nThe eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD destroyed Pompeii.\nThe chariot was spared when the walls and roof of the structure it was in collapsed, and also survived looting by modern-day antiquities thieves, who had dug tunnels through to the site, grazing but not damaging the four-wheeled cart, according to park officials.\nThe chariot was found on the grounds of what is one of the most significant ancient villas in the area around Vesuvius, with a panoramic view of the Mediterranean Sea, on the outskirts of the ancient Roman city.\nArchaeologists last year found in the same area on the outskirts of Pompeii, Civita Giulian, the skeletal remains of what are believed to have been a wealthy man and his male slave, attempting to escape death.\nThe chariot's first iron element emerged on January 7 from the blanket of volcanic material filling the two-story portico. Archaeologists believe the cart was used for festivities and parades, perhaps also to carry brides to their new homes.\nWhile chariots for daily life or the transport of agricultural products have been previously found at Pompeii, officials said the new find is the first ceremonial chariot unearthed in its entirety.\nThe villa was discovered after police came across the illegal tunnels in 2017, officials said.\nTwo people who live in the houses atop the site are currently on trial for allegedly digging more than 80 meters of tunnels at the site. ","76":"Pin-up photos and smutty jokes have long been commonplace on trading floors, but the finance world is gradually opening up to women \u2014 underlined by the arrival on Monday of Jane Fraser at the head of Wall Street banking flagship Citigroup.\nHer elevation marks \"a milestone,\" according to Lorraine Hariton, director of Catalyst, an organisation that promotes women in the workplace.\n\"But there is also a long way to go,\" she said.\nEmployment figures demonstrate the mountains that still have to be moved to achieve parity between men and women in the financial services sector.\nWomen in 2019 made up more than 50 per cent of employees in the field in the United States, but only 22 per cent of managers \u2014 leaving aside the highest positions \u2014 according to a report by Deloitte.\nAlso see | In Pics | These women shattered the glass ceiling in 2020\nCurrent trends predict that figure will rise to 31 per cent by 2030. And male financial analysts earned 17 per cent more on average in 2020 than their female counterparts.\nSeveral women told AFP that they have to work harder than men to climb the ranks, and have to be seen as beyond reproach.\nPrestigious professions and those that pay the most, like investment bankers and traders, still remain strongholds of white men. And sexist remarks still come out from time to time.\n\"For every Jane Fraser, there are hundreds, if not thousands, out there,\" said Muriel Wilkins of the executive consultancy firm Paravis Partner.\n\"Are they being provided with the opportunities to be able to advance?\" she said.\nBut the old certainties have started to shift.\nVague promises about the need to diversify recruiting have gradually led to some real reflection on the issue.\n\"Slowly more leaders... are starting to think and to talk about what it means to have equity in their organisation... and which structures they can put in place so that it is not just on women,\" said Muriel Wilkins.\nAt JPMorgan Chase, America's largest bank by asset size, there has long been an informal women's network.\nIn 2013, women at the most senior level started organising women-only meetings while on business trips around the world so that they could hear employees' thoughts.\nCompany head Jamie Dimon wanted to formalise these various initiatives and so in 2018 the \"Women on the Move\" program was created, said project manager Sam Saperstein.\n\"It allowed us to reinvigorate what we were doing with HR, with training and just pull everything together and elevate it in a clear strategy across the firm,\" she said.\nThe initiative organised a career development program open to all women in the company. About 500 participated in the first session last year, and 2,000 have applied for the second.\nTo tackle the citadel of asset management, which is still the preserve of men, the organisation \"Girls who Invest,\" founded in 2015, has set itself the goal of having 30 per cent of the money invested in funds worldwide managed by women by 2020.\nWomen currently represent only six per cent of managers in venture capital companies, according to the group, and only three per cent in hedge funds.\nThe organisation wants to prove that contrary to popular belief, women are not at all turned off by the job: companies just have to go out and find them.\nIt scours university campuses to recruit students, train them and offer them internships.\n\"The industry had moved tremendously in the past five years,\" said director Katherine Jollon Colsher.\n\"More and more firms are now having 50 per cent female analyst classes and are focused on those same numbers at the associate level.\"\n\"Measurement and holding people accountable is critical to make change,\" said Lorraine Hariton of Catalyst.\nMichael Corbat, Jane Fraser's predecessor, was one of the first in the industry to release statistics on diversity within his firm.\nIt is also essential, Hariton said, for companies to put in place support measures, whether it is sponsorship programs or parental leave.","77":"A second former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo is accusing him of sexual harassment, saying that he asked her questions about her sex life, whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.\nThe aide, Charlotte Bennett, who was an executive assistant and health policy adviser in the Cuomo administration until she left in November, told The New York Times that the governor had harassed her late last spring, during the height of the state\u2019s fight against the coronavirus.\nBennett, 25, said the most unsettling episode occurred June 5, when she was alone with Cuomo in his state Capitol office. In a series of interviews this week, she said the governor had asked her numerous questions about her personal life, including whether she thought age made a difference in romantic relationships, and had said that he was open to relationships with women in their 20s \u2014 comments she interpreted as clear overtures to a sexual relationship.\nCuomo said in a statement to the Times on Saturday that he believed he had been acting as a mentor and had \u201cnever made advances toward Ms. Bennett, nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate.\u201d He said he had requested an independent review of the matter and asked that New Yorkers await the findings \u201cbefore making any judgments.\u201d\nRead: Former aide says New York Governor Cuomo kissed her, suggested strip poker\nBennett said that during the June encounter, the governor, 63, also complained to her about being lonely during the pandemic, mentioning that he \u201ccan\u2019t even hug anyone\u201d before turning the focus to Bennett. She said that Cuomo asked her, \u201cWho did I last hug?\u201d\nBennett said she had tried to dodge the question by responding that she missed hugging her parents. \u201cAnd he was, like, \u2018No, I mean like really hugged somebody?\u2019\u201d she said.\nCuomo never tried to touch her, Bennett said, but the message of the entire episode was unmistakable to her.\n\u201cI understood that the governor wanted to sleep with me, and felt horribly uncomfortable and scared,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cAnd was wondering how I was going to get out of it and assumed it was the end of my job.\u201d\nBennett said she had disclosed the interaction with Cuomo to his chief of staff, Jill DesRosiers, less than a week later and was transferred to another job, as a health policy adviser, with an office on the opposite side of the Capitol, soon after that. Bennett said she had also given a lengthy statement to a special counsel to the governor, Judith Mogul, toward the end of June.\nBennett said she ultimately decided not to insist on an investigation because she was happy in her new job and \u201cwanted to move on.\u201d No action was taken against the governor.\nIn his statement, Cuomo called Bennett a \u201chardworking and valued member\u201d of his staff with \u201cevery right to speak out.\u201d He said that Bennett had opened up to him about being a sexual assault survivor, and he had tried to be supportive and helpful. \u201cThe last thing I would ever have wanted was to make her feel any of the things that are being reported,\u201d the governor said.\nThe governor did not deny that he asked Bennett personal questions; he said in the statement that he would have no further comment until the review concluded.\nBennett\u2019s account follows another detailed accusation, published Wednesday, by Lindsey Boylan, a former state economic development official who said that Cuomo had harassed her on several occasions from 2016 to 2018, at one point giving her an unsolicited kiss on the lips at his Manhattan office.\nCuomo\u2019s office has called Boylan\u2019s accusations untrue, but they have nonetheless prompted calls for investigations into her claims. In addition to the two women\u2019s harassment allegations, the governor, a third-term Democrat, is confronting significant political fallout over his handling of the state\u2019s nursing homes during the pandemic.\nAfter seeing Boylan detail her accusations against Cuomo, Bennett shared Boylan\u2019s account on Twitter, suggesting that people read it if they wanted a true picture of \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to work for the Cuomo\u201d administration.\nThe Times contacted Bennett, and she agreed to relate her own account of harassment. She said she felt an obligation to other victims of sexual harassment and wanted to counter the way Cuomo \u201cwields his power.\u201d\nBennett said she had told her parents and friends about the exchange with the governor around the time that it happened, as well as about her growing discomfort with having to work closely with him, and had kept text messages from that period.\nThe Times reviewed the messages and confirmed their contents with those who received them. Bennett also retained text messages from DesRosiers and Mogul that alluded to their meetings in June but did not mention the subject matter.\n\u201cI have no problem with what they did,\u201d Bennett said of DesRosiers and Mogul, describing both women as sympathetic to her concerns. \u201cI have a problem with what the governor did.\u201d\nBennett was hired by the administration in early 2019, working out of the governor\u2019s Manhattan office as a briefer, an entry-level position. She had graduated from Hamilton College in 2017, where she was active in women\u2019s issues and founded a sexual misconduct task force. She said her own experience in surviving a sexual attack had prompted her to \u201chelp sexual assault survivors be heard and enforce victims\u2019 rights,\u201d according to a bulletin on the college\u2019s website.\nBy mid-2019, Bennett had been promoted to senior briefer and executive assistant after an interview with Cuomo. The two became friendly, she said, and they bonded over shared connections with Westchester County: At the time, he was living with Sandra Lee, a celebrity chef, in Mount Kisco; Bennett was living with her parents in a neighboring hamlet. She mentioned to Cuomo that she had played middle-school soccer against one of his daughters, who are also in their mid-20s.\n\u201cWe got along really well,\u201d she said of the governor. Cuomo, she said, would sometimes ask questions about her dating life that she said seemed inappropriate but not necessarily unmanageable.\n\u201cI saw him more as a father figure,\u201d she said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking about it as anything sexual.\u201d\nIn January 2020, Bennett sent her mother a text. \u201cHad a really long convo with Gov today,\u201d she wrote, outlining a two-hour conversation about numerous topics, including her career goals.\n\u201cHe had a lot to say and was very emotional and serious but also asked a lot of questions,\u201d she wrote, adding, \u201cHe got emotional. Not me.\u201d\nBennett\u2019s mother, Jessica, confirmed the text, and her feeling, at the time, that it was reassuring that the governor seemed to be taking on the role of a mentor.\nCharlotte Bennett said she was asked in late March to begin working in Albany as part of the state\u2019s COVID-19 response effort. Two months later, in mid-May, the governor\u2019s perception of their relationship seemingly began to change, she said.\nOn May 15, she said she arrived at the Capitol around 7 a.m. to find Cuomo already at work. Bennett was there to drop off some briefing papers, but Cuomo was chatty, asking about her love life and, in a gossipy way, whether she was involved with other members of the governor\u2019s staff. She memorialized the exchange in several texts to another Cuomo staff member that the Times reviewed.\nBennett said she had mentioned a speech she was scheduled to give to Hamilton students about her experience as a survivor of sexual assault. She said she had been taken aback by Cuomo\u2019s seeming fixation on that element of her life experience.\n\u201cThe way he was repeating, \u2018You were raped and abused and attacked and assaulted and betrayed,\u2019 over and over again while looking me directly in the eyes was something out of a horror movie,\u201d she wrote in a second text to her friend. \u201cIt was like he was testing me.\u201d\nIn retrospect, Bennett said, she viewed the May 15 meeting \u201cas the turning point in our relationship.\u201d\n\u201cAnything before it I now see differently,\u201d she said. \u201cI now understand that as grooming.\u201d\nThree weeks later, Bennett said, she was summoned to Cuomo\u2019s second-floor office and was asked to take dictation with another aide.\nAfter the second aide left, Cuomo and Bennett continued their work. When they finished, she said, he asked her to turn off her recorder, and he began a winding conversation that touched on the Black Lives Matter protests and his daily news conferences.\nBut, Bennett said, the governor also started to ask questions about her personal life, including whether she was romantically involved, whether she was monogamous in her relationships and whether she had ever had sex with older men.\nA series of text exchanges with a female friend from that afternoon, June 5, comported with Bennett\u2019s recounting of the story this week. In the texts, she told her friend that she was shaken and upset by the episode and worried about even writing it down.\n\u201cSomething just happened and I can\u2019t even type it out or put it in a video,\u201d Bennett wrote.\nBennett went on to say to her friend, who confirmed the texts\u2019 content and validity but asked not to be identified for fear of retribution, that she and the governor had just spoken \u201cabout age differences in relationships.\u201d\nWhen her friend asked whether Cuomo had done anything physical to Bennett, she responded, \u201cNo but it was like the most explicit it could be.\u201d\nThe next day, the women continued to discuss the episode via text. Bennett wrote that the governor had asked her whether she was having sex with other people \u201cwhile in my recent relationships.\u201d\nIn the interview, Bennett said Cuomo told her he was lonely, particularly since the end of his relationship with Lee in 2019. He said Lee was \u201cout of the picture,\u201d according to Bennett, adding that he referred to \u201cwanting a girlfriend, preferably in the Albany area.\u201d\nBennett, who had just turned 25 at the time, said Cuomo had also asked about her feelings about age differences in relationships, saying \u201cage doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d according to a text she sent to her friend.\n\u201cHe asked me if I believed if age made a difference in relationships, and he also asked me in the same conversation if I had ever been with an older man,\u201d Bennett reiterated in an interview with the Times.\nAt one juncture, Bennett said, the governor also noted that he felt \u201che\u2019s fine with anyone above the age of 22,\u201d a point that came up after they discussed her speech at Hamilton on what was her 25th birthday.\nAsked if she felt Cuomo\u2019s questions and comments were an entreaty to a sexual relationship, Bennett said, \u201cThat\u2019s absolutely how it felt.\u201d\nBennett said that she had felt deeply uncomfortable with Cuomo\u2019s comments and had tried to shift the conversation into more neutral territory \u2014 something \u201cnot about my sex life,\u201d she recalled \u2014 like intellectual theories about monogamy and power dynamics, and even a tattoo she was considering getting.\nShe said Cuomo had suggested that perhaps she should put the tattoo on her buttocks so people would not see it when she wore a dress.\nA friend of Bennett\u2019s, a former Cuomo administration official, said he had spoken to her shortly after the June 5 episode. He confirmed the contours of her account, saying that she had made it clear to him that she believed the governor wanted to have sex with her.\nBennett told her parents about the encounter within days, her mother recalled, saying her daughter had made a special visit home to do so. \u201cShe was obviously upset,\u201d Bennett\u2019s mother said.\nBennett said she spoke to Cuomo\u2019s chief of staff, DesRosiers, on June 10, five days after the episode.\nShe said the meeting, in DesRosiers\u2019 office, had lasted about 10 minutes. Bennett said she had recounted her interaction with Cuomo, and she recalled that DesRosiers had asked a few questions, been apologetic and asked to speak to her again in two days.\nIn a text message sent to a friend after the meeting, Bennett said DesRosiers had said, \u201cHow can we do this?\u201d asking whether she wanted to stay in the executive branch or move to another part of the state government.\nWhen Bennett\u2019s friend asked what that meant, Bennett explained that an outside job would still be with the administration, but \u201cjust not interacting with him.\u201d\nShe also told her friend, in the same series of texts, that she trusted DesRosiers but was worried about Cuomo\u2019s reaction: \u201cI just said I didn\u2019t want him to find out and get mad.\u201d\nTwo days later, on June 12, DesRosiers told Bennett she would be transferred to a new position as a health policy adviser, still working in the executive branch, but in a different part of the Capitol. Her new job was announced in a June 17 email to Department of Health officials. \u201cWelcome Charlotte!\u201d it concluded.\nLater that month, Bennett met with Mogul, a special counsel to the governor, and repeated her claims. She said, however, that she soon decided to \u201clet this go and move on.\u201d\nIn a statement Saturday, Beth Garvey, another special counsel to the governor, said that \u201cMs. Bennett\u2019s concerns were treated with sensitivity and respect and in accordance with applicable law and policy.\u201d She characterized the transfer to a health policy position as fulfilling \u201ca long-standing interest\u201d of Bennett\u2019s.\nOf Bennett, Garvey said, \u201cshe was consulted regarding the resolution and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.\u201d Barbara Jones, a former federal judge in Manhattan, will lead the outside review into the matter, Garvey said.\nBennett left state government last fall, and she now lives and works in a neighboring state. She said that her anger about what had happened had continued to percolate and had led to her departure.\n\u201cHis presence was suffocating,\u201d she said. \u201cI was thinking that I could recover and have distance, but that is so naive.\u201d\nShe added that she had been committed to her job in the administration, even after her interactions with Cuomo, and had tried to \u201cnot have him ruin this for me.\u201d\nBut, she said, \u201cI learned that\u2019s not how that works.\u201d","78":"The Medical Board of California said it would investigate a plastic surgeon who appeared in a videoconference for his traffic violation trial while operating.\nThe Sacramento Bee reports Dr Scott Green appeared Thursday for his Sacramento Superior Court trial, held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic, from an operating room. He was dressed in surgical scrubs with a patient undergoing the procedure just out of view; the beeps of medical machinery can be heard in the background.\n\u201cHello, Mr Green? Hi. Are you available for trial?\u201d asked a courtroom clerk as an officer summoned to appear in trial raised her eyebrows. \u201cIt kind of looks like you're in an operating room right now?\u201d\n\u201cI am, sir,\u201d Green replied. \u201cYes, I'm in an operating room right now. Yes, I'm available for trial. Go right ahead.\u201d\nThe clerk reminded Green the proceedings were being livestreamed because traffic trials are required by law to be open to the public, and Green said he understood. He appeared to continue working with his head down while waiting for Court Commissioner Gary Link to enter the chamber.\nWhen Link appeared and saw the doctor on the screen, the judge hesitated to proceed with the trial out of concern for the welfare of the patient.\n\u201cI have another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me, so I can stand here and allow them to do the surgery also,\u201d Green said.\nThe judge said he didn't think it was appropriate to conduct trial under the circumstances. He told Green he'd rather set a new date for trial \u201cwhen you're not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient.\u201d\nGreen apologised.\n\u201cSometimes, surgery doesn't always go as,\u201d he said before the judge interrupted him.\n\u201cIt happens. We want to keep people healthy, we want to keep them alive. That's important,\" Link said.\nThe board said it would look into the incident, saying it \u201cexpects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients.\u201d\nA call seeking comment from Green has not been returned.","79":"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called on Saturday for an outside review following a report of sexual misconduct allegations against him by a second former aide, compounding problems for one of America's most well-known Democratic politicians.\nCharlotte Bennett told the New York Times that Cuomo had asked her questions about her sex life, including whether she was monogamous in her relationships and if she had ever had sex with older men.\nCuomo, in a statement, denied making sexual advances.\nReuters has not independently verified the account and accusations by Bennett. She worked for the governor as an executive assistant and policy advisor for nearly two years until November 2020, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nRead: Former aide says New York Governor Cuomo kissed her, suggested strip poker\n\"I was trying to be a mentor to her. I never made advances toward Ms. Bennett nor did I ever intend to act in any way that was inappropriate,\" Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday.\nHe called for \"a full and thorough outside review\" led by a former federal judge and said he would have no further comment until it was completed.\nBennett did not immediately return a request for comment sent via Twitter.\nCuomo rose to national prominence for his leadership at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when New York was the country's Covid-19 epicenter.\nThe latest accusations came just days after another former aide, Lindsey Boylan, wrote in an online essay that the governor made several \"inappropriate gestures\" toward her while she worked for the state government from 2015 to 2018.\nThey ranged from sending her a rose on Valentine's Day to kissing her on the mouth, she said.\nBoylan is now a candidate for Manhattan borough president.\nRead: Cuomo accused of sexual harassment by second former aide\nCuomo denied those accusations in December and issued another denial this week. Multiple attempts to reach Boylan have been unsuccessful.\nBennett, who is 25, told the Times that Cuomo said to her in one encounter in June that he was open to relationships with women in their 20s.\nBennett said she discussed the interaction with Cuomo's chief of staff Jill DesRosiers and was subsequently transferred to a job as a health policy advisor to the governor. She also provided a statement to a special counsel to the governor, Judith Mogul, in June, she told the Times.\nBeth Garvey, special counsel and senior advisor to Cuomo, said in a statement that Bennett had been \"consulted regarding the resolution, and expressed satisfaction and appreciation for the way in which it was handled.\"\n\"The determination reached based on the information Ms Bennett provided was that no further action was required which was consistent with Ms Bennett's wishes,\" Garvey said.\nAllegations about his conduct with female aides follow another major controversy that has dogged Cuomo in recent weeks.\nA report from the state attorney general's office last month cast doubt on the Cuomo administration's handling of the Covid-19 crisis in nursing homes, saying that the state health department significantly undercounted the toll and implemented policies that may have contributed to it.\nA top aide to Cuomo later told lawmakers the administration had delayed providing requested data about Covid-19 death toll among nursing home residents for fear of a politically motivated investigation by the Justice Department under the then-president, Republican Donald Trump.","80":"For decades, the normal course of action for presidents departing the White House has been to lie low and let their successors have the stage to themselves in their first months in office.\nBut Donald Trump was never a normal president. And less than two months after he departed Washington as a twice-impeached leader whose supporters stormed the Capitol to try to thwart the certification of a democratic election, Trump will attract a national spotlight as the final act at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday.\n\u201cHis presidency was unlike any other, so why would we expect his post-presidency to be like any other?\u201d said James Carville, the Democratic strategist most associated with former President Bill Clinton\u2019s success in 1992.\nWhen Clinton left office in early 2001, it was also as an impeached president. But Clinton took at least some time out of view before emerging with a philanthropic group that he went on to build up for years.\nRead: Biden White House asks 'Trump who?' ahead of speech to conservatives\nOf Trump, Carville said, \u201cIt would have been utterly surprising if he would have gone away and worked on a memoir or taught a Zoom class at a state university.\u201d\nTrump is set to deliver a closing speech at CPAC that is expected to be a withering critique of President Joe Biden\u2019s first few weeks in office, touching on topics ranging from shuttered schools to immigration policy, said an adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the unfinished speech.\nHe isn\u2019t expected to deliver a lengthy list of his own accomplishments in office and will aim to sound more like the candidate he was in 2016 than the campaigner he was in 2020, the adviser said. And there will be some focus on the future of the Republican Party.\nWhen former President Barack Obama left office, he was photographed kite-surfing in February 2017, a relaxed smile on his face. His predecessor, George W. Bush, made clear his disdain for Washington and his eagerness to escape it. Karl Rove, the architect of Bush\u2019s campaign, called it \u201chighly unusual\u201d for a former president not to give the incoming chief executive a grace period of his own silence.\nRead: Trump the dominant force at conservative conference\nTrump has been relatively selective in speaking publicly since he left the White House, after being cautioned by advisers not to say anything that might make him a larger target for the various prosecutors considering or pursuing investigations related to him. Without his Twitter feed and the presence of reporters assigned to cover the presidency, the attention that Trump craves so deeply has been in short supply.\nYet his grip on the Republican Party remains strong. Members of Congress, fearing backlash from Trump\u2019s voters, have made plain their desire to move past any discussion of responsibility for months of helping Trump spread the baseless claim that the election was stolen from him by shadowy forces in the Democratic Party.\nHe was widely hailed on the first day of the CPAC convention Friday.\n\u201cLet me tell you right now,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, \u201cDonald J. Trump ain\u2019t goin\u2019 anywhere.\u201d Even Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader who at one point let it be known that he might vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial, told Fox News this past week that he would support Trump if he were to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2024.\nRead: As Trump returns to political stage, nagging questions about 2024\nTo that end, Trump is serious at the moment about running for president a third time in 2024. While some aides expect that he ultimately won\u2019t go through with another bid, his musings could have a chilling effect on his party.\n\u201cThere was never a consideration of, Should George H.W. Bush run again?\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which organizes the conference. Trump is \u201cin a different place, and he\u2019s also still incredibly popular with the people who voted for him.\u201d\nTrump has discussed with aides the possibility of writing a book. And he has started putting together a political operation with long-serving aides including Bill Stepien, the campaign manager at the end of 2020; Justin Clark, the counsel on his campaign; and Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, his former campaign manager and deputy campaign manager. Brad Parscale, who was removed as the 2020 campaign manager last summer, remains in the Trump circle and is handling Trump\u2019s email system.\nJason Miller, Trump\u2019s senior adviser, remains close to him. And Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., is set to take a more active role in his political organization than he previously had.\nMost members of that group had an hourslong meeting Thursday with Trump, for whom few former aides are ever permanently cast aside.\nThe former president is setting up a process for people looking to receive his endorsement, but he has made it clear that he is also determined to extract vengeance against Republicans who crossed him by questioning his lies about the election or by voting in support of impeachment. On Friday, he endorsed a former aide, Max Miller, as a primary challenger to Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, who voted in favor of impeachment.\nRead: When you don\u2019t have Trump to hide behind\nWhat remains to be seen at CPAC is whether Trump will attempt to revive his false statements about a \u201crigged\u201d 2020 election. His advisers are imploring him not to, and they say the hope is that Trump will focus on suggesting changes to election rules across the country.\nEven if he doesn\u2019t say it himself, CPAC \u2014 once a forum for conservative ideas with a strong libertarian strain \u2014 has been transformed into a cult of personality around Trump. So far at the four-day gathering, a golden statue of Trump has been pushed around the Orlando, Florida, venue, with no apparent sense of irony. The event is being held away from Washington, its customary home, because regulations intended to slow the spread of COVID-19 are more lax in Florida.\nTrump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud have already gotten a boost at the gathering; a panel titled \u201cHow Judges & Media Refused to Look at the Evidence\u201d was conducted Friday.\nIn a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Rove wrote that Trump should steer away from his desire to discuss payback against other Republicans.\n\u201cMr. Trump took this approach in his disastrous campaign stop the night before the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate runoffs,\u201d Rove wrote. \u201cIf he repeats it at CPAC, he\u2019ll be speaking to the shrinking share of the electorate that believes his every claim.\u201d He urged Trump to take a \u201cmore constructive\u201d approach.\nFew Republicans believe that Trump has the discipline to drop his desire for attention for long, if at all. Already, he has shown flashes of behaving like the political gadfly in search of attention he was in the years leading up to his run in 2016.\nRead: After Trump acquittal, Republicans see 'battle for soul of party'\nWhen Trump was considering a bid for president as early as 2011, he used his Twitter feed and his frequent Fox News appearances to inject himself into nearly every topic in the news cycle. Trump\u2019s advisers insist that he says he is happier without his Twitter feed.\nBut just a few weeks out of office, Trump has at times relied on the same impulse: getting media attention for topics in the news, such as the death of radio host Rush Limbaugh or the car accident that felled golfer Tiger Woods, to speak to an audience that is already supportive of him.\n\u201cIn 2013 and 2014, Mr. Trump wanted \u2018to be part of the action,\u2019\u201d recalled Sam Nunberg, a former adviser to the Trump campaign in 2016. Now, as a former president, Nunberg said, Trump \u201chas \u2018to be part of the action\u2019 to keep his precarious grip as the leading contender for the 2024 GOP primary.\u201d\n\u201cThe reality is that speaking at CPAC so soon after becoming only the 10th president to lose reelection is a sign of weakness,\u201d Nunberg said.","81":"President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda is facing its most consequential test as Democrats prepare to manoeuvre his $1.9 trillion stimulus package through the evenly divided Senate, an effort that could strain the fragile alliance between progressives and centrists and the limits of his power in Congress.\nAn early-morning House vote to pass the sweeping pandemic aid measure only underscored the depth of partisan division over the proposal, which was opposed by every Republican. But the road ahead in the Senate is far bumpier, with a thicket of arcane rules and a one-vote margin of control threatening to imperil crucial aspects of the plan as Democrats rush to deliver it to Biden\u2019s desk within two weeks.\nAlready, Biden\u2019s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 as part of the plan has run aground because of budgetary rules for the measure, which Democrats are advancing under a complex process that allows it to pass by simple majority vote, bypassing Republican opposition.\nAlso read: US House passes $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill, sends it to Senate\nIn the week ahead, they will also face challenges in steering other aspects of the bill through procedural obstacles and around political pitfalls, including debates over how much to spend on closing state and local budget shortfalls and how to distribute expanded tax benefits aimed at helping impoverished families.\nThe challenge for Biden will be holding both sides together in the face of unified Republican opposition to secure a bill that White House officials believe will cushion vulnerable Americans through the end of the pandemic and turbo-boost the economy as it reopens in full.\n\u201cWe have no time to waste,\u201d Biden said Saturday at the White House. \u201cIf we act now, decisively, quickly and boldly, we can finally get ahead of this virus.\u201d\nProgressives are pushing hard for party leaders to change Senate rules to keep the wage increase in the bill, arguing that Democrats must not scale back their ambitions for Biden\u2019s first major legislative package.\nThe debate over the minimum wage, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters, \u201csets the stage for how effective we\u2019ll be for the rest of the term.\u201d\nBut moderates including Sens. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona want to keep Senate rules \u2014 which effectively require 60 votes to advance most major legislation \u2014 intact and are opposed to including such a sharp increase in the minimum wage in the package.\nParty leaders and White House officials remain confident that Biden has the votes, no matter the fate of the wage increase. All but two House Democrats voted for the legislation, called the American Rescue Plan, which has broad bipartisan support among voters. But congressional Republicans have united against it after being effectively frozen out of drafting the bill.\n\u201cThe House\u2019s partisan vote reflects a deliberately partisan process and a missed opportunity to meet Americans\u2019 needs,\u201d Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the minority leader, said in a statement.\nThe measure now moves to the Senate, which is split 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris controlling the tiebreaking vote. Biden\u2019s early attempts to find common ground with moderate Republican senators on the package yielded little other than general expressions of bipartisan aspiration, with the Republicans proposing a plan amounting to less than one-third of what the president is asking to address the toll of a crisis that has left 10 million Americans out of work.\nWith unemployment benefits set to begin lapsing March 14 for the workers who have been thrown off the job longest in the crisis, Democrats have only two weeks to finish the package in the Senate and resend it to the House and Biden\u2019s desk. Because party leaders decided to use a fast-track budget process known as reconciliation to swiftly move the legislation and circumvent Republican opposition in the Senate, the bill will need to comply with a series of strict budgetary rules along the way.\nWhile the House included the federal minimum wage increase in the version it passed Saturday, a key Senate official has warned that it violates the reconciliation rules, enabling Republicans to challenge it and jettison it from the package. It is likely that more changes to the bill will be needed to ensure it complies with Senate rules and can draw the support of every Democrat.\nSenate Democrats are now spending the weekend plotting possible ways to salvage the minimum wage provision, which would gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2025.\nProgressives in the House warned Friday that they might withhold their votes for the stimulus package if the wage increase were removed. The debate has fueled an already simmering dispute over whether Democrats should try to abolish Senate rules \u2014 chiefly, those governing filibusters that mandate a 60-vote threshold to move forward \u2014 that the minority party has long used to block major legislative initiatives.\n\u201cThis is not a matter of whether you have the votes; this is a matter of whether you do what you said,\u201d said the Rev. William Barber II, a co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, a grassroots organisation that plans to continue lobbying Manchin, Sinema and other lawmakers to overrule the parliamentarian and abolish the filibuster. \u201cDon\u2019t hide behind a rule. Don\u2019t hide behind a backdoor meeting.\u201d\nBiden has acknowledged publicly that the wage increase could fall out of the bill and indicated he would sign the package regardless. His chief of staff, Ron Klain, ruled out the possibility that Harris would override the guidance of Elizabeth MacDonough, the Senate parliamentarian who has said the proposal is out of order under reconciliation. Top Democrats have signaled that they have no plans to oust MacDonough, who became the first woman to hold the post in 2012, despite liberal calls to do so.\nStill, White House economic officials argue that even the increase of the wage to $9.50 this year, as the bill calls for, would bolster incomes and spending for the lowest-paid workers in the economy, helping fuel economic growth.\nAlso read: Biden White House asks 'Trump who?' ahead of speech to conservatives\nDemocrats have begun drafting alternative plans \u2014 including tax penalties for large corporations that pay low hourly wages \u2014 that could qualify under Senate rules and achieve similar goals. Top Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, are contemplating the possibility of including an amendment that would penalize corporations that pay workers less than $15 an hour, potentially imposing an escalating tax on the payrolls of large corporations.\nParty leaders say they will find a middle ground that will allow the stimulus package to move forward.\n\u201cWe have a consensus in our caucus that we are here to get the job done for the American people,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said Friday at a news conference. Pressed on whether Democrats would ultimately be able to pass the legislation without the inclusion of the minimum wage provision, she said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\nDemocrats are bracing for additional revisions to the legislation as a result of MacDonough\u2019s guidance, including changing how quickly people can reap the benefits of an expanded tax credit meant to help low-income families with children. With some moderate Democrats in favour of targeting elements of the relief plan, they may also be forced to scale back or otherwise alter how the $350 billion allotted for state, local and tribal governments is distributed.\nRepublicans face perils of their own in opposing the measure en masse. The bill enjoys strong and bipartisan support in national polls, with 7 in 10 Americans approving. Most polls show significant backing among Republican voters for the effort. Some show majority Republican support.\nCritical provisions of the bill that Republican lawmakers have derided as wasteful \u2014 including direct payments of $1,400 per adult and child to individuals earning up to $75,000 a year and couples earning up to $150,000 \u2014 are backed by as many as 4 in 5 Americans.\nBusiness groups and budget hawks have staked out a middle ground, urging Democrats to pare back or amend the package in the Senate. The US Chamber of Commerce has called for a bipartisan compromise on raising the wage, to an amount less than $15 an hour. The US Travel Association called on lawmakers Saturday to take additional steps in the bill to support an industry that \u201clost half a trillion dollars and millions of jobs last year\u201d \u2014 with no immediate rebound in sight.\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which has raised concerns over the size of the package and the targeting of its spending, urged lawmakers to reduce the bill\u2019s $350 billion in aid to state and local governments and to scale back the number of Americans who receive direct payments in order to avoid sending money to people who have not lost hours or income in the crisis.\nAlso read: US in delicate balancing act as Saudi Prince spared sanctions\nBut without the majority support needed to eliminate the Senate filibuster, some Democrats are looking toward negotiations with Republicans as the only way to push a minimum wage increase into law.\n\u201cNot the answer we hoped for, but the one as a lawyer I expected,\u201d Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., wrote on Twitter of the parliamentarian\u2019s rejection of the minimum wage provision, which he called \u201cwithin bounds.\u201d\n\u201cNow we need to get it done the hard, old-fashioned way,\u201d he added.","82":"Opponents of military rule in Myanmar planned protests on Sunday a day after the security forces launched their biggest crackdown, arresting hundreds of people and shooting and wounding at least one.\nState television announced that Myanmar's UN envoy had been fired for betraying the country, after he urged the United Nations to use \"any means necessary\" to reverse the February 1 coup that ousted elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\nHe vowed to fight on.\nAlso read: Myanmar police fire rubber bullets on protesters as UN envoy breaks ranks\n\"I decided to fight back as long as I can,\" Kyaw Moe Tun told Reuters in New York.\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power and detained Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership, alleging fraud in a November election her party won in a landslide.\nThe coup, which stalled Myanmar's progress toward democracy, has brought hundreds of thousands of protesters onto the streets and drawn condemnation from Western countries, with some imposing limited sanctions.\nPeople scoured hardware shops on Saturday for helmets and items they could use for masks and shields, posts on social media showed, with the Burmese-language tag #iwillbeonthestreet.\nSaturday saw turmoil in towns and cities across the country as police moved forcefully to stamp out the protests, firing tear gas, setting off stun grenades and shooting guns into the air.\nUniformed police and plain-clothes security men set upon some people with clubs, witnesses said.\nState-run MRTV television said more than 470 people had been arrested in all.

Passengers captured video, much of it shared on social media, of the plane\u2019s Pratt & Whitney engine, its cover ripped off, its turbine oscillating and in flames. The plane, which had 231 passengers and 10 crew members on board, returned to Denver and landed safely.\nAn eerily similar incident played out the same day in the Netherlands with a Boeing 747-400 cargo jet. That plane\u2019s engine, while different from the Boeing 777 in Colorado, was also manufactured by Pratt & Whitney, and it also caught fire and spewed metal parts before the plane made its own safe emergency landing.\nAlso read: Boeing 777 with engine trouble makes emergency landing in Moscow\nAnd Friday, a long-haul Boeing 777 carrying cargo and 25 people made an emergency landing in Moscow after an indicator warned of the possible failure of its General Electric engine.\nThe events in Colorado and the Netherlands were the latest in a string of dramatic high-altitude failures over the past few years.\nIn 2018, another United Airlines flight, also heading to Honolulu, experienced a nearly identical engine failure as the one seen over Colorado. So did a Japan Airlines flight heading from Tokyo to Okinawa in 2020. Both of those planes were also Boeing 777-200s equipped with Pratt & Whitney engines.\nOther aircraft have had major incidents: The midair engine explosion of a Southwest jet in 2018 caused the death of a passenger, Jennifer Riordan.

And then there were the two devastating crashes of Boeing 737 Max planes, which killed a total of 346 people and caused the entire fleet to be grounded for nearly two years.\nAlso read: Boeing grounds 777s after engine fire in Colorado\nOn February 21, United, the only US carrier whose 777s are powered by that particular Pratt & Whitney engine, ordered all of them thoroughly checked before they could fly again, while Boeing said that 128 of its 777 jetliners worldwide should be temporarily taken out of service. An initial investigation pointed to metal fatigue in the engine\u2019s fan blades, and the Federal Aviation Administration on Tuesday said Pratt & Whitney engines on Boeing 777s must be inspected before the planes return to the sky.\nStatistically, commercial air travel has proved to be extremely safe, and episodes like the one seen over Colorado on February 20 are rare. But anxious flyers feeling an extra jolt of the jitters may now be asking how commercial airplanes are maintained and serviced, and how much they can learn about the planes they are assigned to fly on before they get onboard. Here are some answers.\nQ: How can I find out what kind of plane I\u2019ll be flying on, and can I switch?\nA: Depending on the airline you\u2019re flying, determining the aircraft assigned to you is often as simple as taking a closer look at your reservation. Most airlines list this information right on their online booking page, near the flight details.\nIf you can\u2019t find it there, websites, including SeatGuru, which offers seating maps and customer reviews of most models of airplanes, and FlightRadar24, which lets visitors track any flight in real time, both make it easy to see the make and model of the aircraft assigned to any chosen flight.\nIf you\u2019re looking for an airplane\u2019s engine model, you\u2019ll have to dig a bit deeper. Airfleets.net will give you that information, but you\u2019ll need your aircraft\u2019s tail number. It\u2019s a series of six numbers and letters, starting with N, and you can find it by searching for your flight on either SeatGuru or FlightRadar24, or, if you\u2019re already at the gate, by actually looking at your plane. As the name implies, the number is visible on the aircraft\u2019s tail.\nAlso Read: Why the Boeing 777 problem isn't as dire as the MAX crisis\nBut don\u2019t be surprised if your airline makes a last-minute change that puts you on a different plane entirely. Such switches are common, which makes it futile to book an itinerary based on a preferred model of plane.\n\u201cWhat you book today is not necessarily the plane you\u2019re going to take when the trip comes,\u201d said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of the travel loyalty website The Points Guy.\nCovid-19, which has upended many airlines\u2019 flight schedules, has made this practice even more common. But it has also made it easier for passengers to switch flights if they\u2019re uncomfortable boarding the aircraft assigned to them.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no consumer law that says if you don\u2019t want to fly on a certain aircraft, they have to accommodate you, but most airlines have waived their change fees,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to change flights than it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\nQ: How often do airplanes receive routine maintenance?\nA: Constantly. Before every flight, pilots do a walk-around inspection of the plane and its equipment; the FAA mandates that deeper inspections of planes must be conducted at least every 100 flight hours. After about 6,000 flight hours \u2014 the timing depends on the aircraft \u2014 planes get what\u2019s called a C Check, which will remove them from service for a full week or longer while technicians perform a deep inspection of all of their parts. A D Check, the most intensive maintenance visit, involves fully dismantling the plane to check for damage in every nook and cranny; these happen every six to 10 years.\nThere are additional, mandatory schedules for maintenance and service checks stipulated by the specific manufacturer of each aircraft\u2019s many parts. And there are surprise inspections, too.\n\u201cThe FAA conducts random checks on all certified operators in which we may look at maintenance records, the aircraft themselves, or both,\u201d said Ian Gregor, a public-affairs specialist for the FAA.\nIn the case of United\u2019s 777-200, the metal fatigue that caused the engine\u2019s fan blades to snap off was likely invisible to the naked eye. But those blades should have been inspected via thermal acoustic imaging, which can reveal microscopic cracks, relatively recently; in March 2019 the FAA ordered extra checks on Pratt & Whitney engines after an engine failure on a different United flight.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known about metal fatigue since the Industrial Revolution,\u201d said Mark Baier, CEO of AviationManuals, which produces safety manuals and aviation safety management software. \u201cIt\u2019s just something that happens. But what this demonstrated was actually how incredibly safe these aircraft are, because the aircraft continued to fly quite normally.\u201d\nQ: Do different airlines have different safety protocols?\nA: Not in the United States. \u201cFAA regulations apply to all airlines uniformly,\u201d Gregor said.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that violations don\u2019t happen.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not unheard of for airlines to operate with maintenance issues, or for corners to be cut,\u201d said Loretta Alkalay, a former FAA attorney and an adjunct professor at Vaughn College of Aeronautics in Queens, New York. \u201cThere are definitely some operators who are less meticulous than others.\u201d\nWhen an airline is in violation of regulations, the FAA initiates enforcement actions, which involve penalties. These are published on their website and can be read by the public.\nTravelers wanting more insight on an airline\u2019s safety ratings can check out Airline Ratings, which rates safety on a seven-star scale based on crash and pilot incidence data, audits from the International Civil Aviation Organization and even Covid-19 compliance. The site even has a feature to compare selected airlines.\nBut the safety records of all US airlines are so uniformly excellent, said Patrick Smith, a commercial pilot and host of the aviation website Ask the Pilot, that obsessing over whether one airline poses a greater risk than another is a waste of time.\n\u201cYou can drive yourself crazy poring over the fractions of a percentage that differentiate one carrier\u2019s fatality rate from another\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, they\u2019re the same.\u201d\nQ: Are older planes less safe than new ones?\nA: The 777 involved in the Colorado incident had been flying since 1995. The 2018 United flight to Honolulu that also experienced engine failure was built in 1996; a Boeing plane that crashed into the Java Sea in Indonesia in January was 26 years old. Should passengers be wary of flying on aging planes?\n\u201cThe data doesn\u2019t really bear that out,\u201d said Baier. \u201cAnd a lot of older airplanes are upgraded with new equipment or systems.\u201d\nAlso, the more a plane flies, the more maintenance checks it receives.\n\u201cCommercial jets are built to last more or less indefinitely,\u201d said Smith, the pilot. \u201cThe older a plane gets, the more and better care it needs, and inspection criteria grow increasingly strict.\u201d\nKelly, of The Points Guy, explains on his site that anyone can check the age of a plane on FlightRadar24, as long as they\u2019ve paid for a Silver membership to the site. For his part, however, he says that he doesn\u2019t consider a plane\u2019s age when booking. \u201cThe 737 Max was a brand-new airplane,\u201d he said, \u201cand it was very problematic. I would not say old planes are any less safe than new ones.\u201d\nQ: If an issue is discovered during a standard maintenance check, what happens next?\nA: The pilot will call for a maintenance team, who will attempt to fix the issue on the ground (often while passengers wait at the gate). If the issue is minor but can\u2019t be fixed immediately, the plane might still fly \u2014 air operators follow a document called the Minimum Equipment List, a list of systems and parts that can be inoperable and the plane can still fly.\nIf the maintenance issue is critical and the plane can\u2019t be flown until it\u2019s repaired, it will be taken out of service until it\u2019s fixed. Safety issues with parts and aircraft prompt the FAA to issue airworthiness directives, which notify all airlines making use of similar equipment that inspection, and potentially corrective action, is required.\nBefore the plane in question is returned to operation, crews will run several series of tests, probably including a flight or two, before supervisors will sign off on the mechanics\u2019 work.\nAnd what if an issue arises in flight, as it did on February 20? Pilots are prepared for moments like those, said Dan Bubb, a former pilot and an expert on aviation history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re flying, you\u2019re always anticipating what could go wrong so you can get in front of it,\u201d Bubb said. \u201cPilots regularly undergo training for all sorts of scenarios. And when it happens, your training kicks in. The pilots did a textbook job of safely landing that plane.\u201d","84":"Ten men were killed and a woman and two boys were wounded in a shooting attack on a home in western Mexico Saturday.\nProsecutors in the state of Jalisco said the bullet-ridden bodies of the 10 men were found by police on the sidewalk in front of the home. Another wounded boy was found inside, and a woman and another boy were located at a local hospital.\nThe prosecutors' office said the attack was carried out by unidentified assailants travelling in an SUV.\nThe state is home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, one of Mexico's most violent and powerful. More bodies have been found in clandestine burial pits in Jalisco there than in any other state in recent years. The cartel has been fighting a breakaway faction in and around Guadalajara.\nEarlier this month, police found 18 plastic bags full of hacked-up body parts on the outskirts of Guadalajara, the state capital.\nIn November, Jalisco authorities recovered 113 bodies and additional human remains from a secret grave in the town of El Salto, just outside Guadalajara. A total of 189 corpses were discovered in the town throughout 2020.","85":"Reiterating that only a two-state solution will deliver enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine deserve, India has said this should be achieved through direct negotiations between both sides on final status issues and any unilateral action which could prejudice these issues must be avoided.\nIndia\u2019s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador K Nagaraj Naidu said on Friday at the UN Security Council meeting on \u2018The situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question\u2019 that New Delhi reaffirms its support to the Palestinian cause and the establishment of a sovereign, viable and independent State of Palestine living side by side in peace and security with Israel.\n\u201cWe firmly believe that only a two-state solution will deliver enduring peace that the people of Israel and Palestine desire and deserve. This should be achieved through direct negotiations between both sides on final status issues. Both sides must avoid any unilateral action which could prejudice these final status issues,\u201d he said.\nNaidu termed the recent diplomatic efforts to revive the stalled peace talks as encouraging and added that the meeting of the Quartet\u2019s Special Envoys is timely.

The Cairo agreement between the Palestinian parties on the conduct of parliamentary and presidential elections - to abide by the electoral timetable, accept the results of the election and on other election-related arrangements - is a positive step in the right direction, he said.\nNoting that the commitment undertaken by all parties to release political detainees will also help build trust between them, India acknowledged Egypt\u2019s efforts in facilitating this agreement. The high percentage of Palestinians, who have registered to vote in the elections, reflects their desire to take part in the democratic process, he said.\nWennesland said the holding of free and fair elections in the Palestinian Territory will help \u201cclear the path\u201d for restoring a legitimate political horizon to realise a long-sought two-State solution.\nThe elections will provide a crucial step towards re-establishing Palestinian national unity \u2013 and renewing the legitimacy of national institutions, including a democratically elected Legislative Council and Government in Palestine, he said.\nNaidu added that the opening of Rafah border crossing is a significant development, which will ease the humanitarian and health situation in Gaza.\nIndia stressed that the pandemic\u2019s impact on the people of Gaza has been particularly severe due to the fragile health-care infrastructure.\nNoting that Covid-19 vaccines are being made available to the people of Palestine, including in Gaza, Naidu said India strongly believes that \u201cequity in access\u201d to vaccines across the world is important for mitigating the impact of the pandemic.\nIndia has provided critical medicines and medical equipment to Palestine as Covid-19 assistance and is now in the process of sending a second batch of medicines as a grant to the Palestinian people in the coming weeks.\n\u201cWe will also facilitate an early supply of vaccines to Palestine,\u201d Naidu said.\nOn Covid vaccination prospects, Wennesland welcomed the announcement of the Palestinian vaccination strategy and the initial allocation to the Palestinian Ministry of Health of 37,440 doses of vaccines by the COVAX-AMC facility.","86":"Pope Francis expects to die in Rome, still the Catholic pontiff, without returning to spend his final days in his native Argentina, according to a new book titled \"The Health of Popes.\"\nIn an interview granted to Argentine journalist and physician Nelson Castro at the Vatican in February 2019, the pope said he thinks about death, but does not fear it.\nExtracts from the book were published Saturday in Argentine daily La Nacion.\nAsked how he sees his final days, Francis, who is 84, responded: \"I will be pope, either active or emeritus, and in Rome. I will not return to Argentina.\"\nFrancis has had to cancel some events in recent months due to a painful problem with sciatica, but is not known to suffer any other major ailments.\nThe Vatican has always been reticent about a pope's health.\nAccording to the new book, \"This is the first time that a pope has discussed his health with the transparency afforded by Francis.\"\nThe pontiff, formerly the archbishop of Buenos Aires, says he does not miss his native Argentina, where he was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the son of Italian immigrants.\n\"No, I do not miss it. I lived there for 76 years. What pains me are its problems\" -- an allusion to the economic crisis shaking the South American country.\nThe pope has been vaccinated against Covid-19.\nBeyond his age, the leader of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics is considered to be high-risk: in 1957, aged 21, he suffered from acute pleurisy and had part of his right lung removed.","87":"Myanmar's United Nations envoy in New York vowed to fight on Saturday after the junta fired him for urging countries to use \"any means necessary\" to reverse a Feb. 1 coup that ousted the nation's elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\"I decided to fight back as long as I can,\" Kyaw Moe Tun told Reuters on Saturday.\nMyanmar state television announced on Saturday that Kyaw Moe Tun had been fired for betraying the country.\nHowever, the United Nations does not officially recognise the junta as Myanmar's new government as it has received no official notification of any change, said a U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, and so Kyaw Moe Tun remains Myanmar's U.N. ambassador, for now.\n\"We have not received any communication concerning changes to the representation of Myanmar at the United Nations in New York,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Friday that no country should recognize or legitimize the Myanmar junta.\nIf the Myanmar junta, led by General Min Aung Hlaing, tries to seek international recognition by installing a new U.N. envoy it could set off a fight at the world body that could culminate with a vote at the General Assembly.\nThe U.N. has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body.\nIn September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country's interim government. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized the new authorities.\nKyaw Moe Tun told the United Nations on Friday that he was speaking for Suu Kyi's government and appealed for help to overturn \"the illegal and unconstitutional military coup.\" Such an address - at odds with those in power in a country - is rare.\nElected lawmakers ousted in the coup have formed a committee and Kyaw Moe Tun said that is the \"legitimate and duly elected government of Myanmar and must be recognized by the international community as such.\"\nGuterres has pledged to mobilize international pressure \"to make sure that this coup fails.\" The Security Council has voiced concern over the state of emergency, but stopped short of condemning the coup due to opposition by Russia and China.","88":"Virginia lawmakers gave final approval Saturday to a bill that will legalise marijuana for adult recreational use, but not until 2024, when retail sales of the drug would also begin.\nWith a compromise bill clearing the House and Senate, Virginia becomes the first Southern state to vote to legalise marijuana, joining 15 other states and the District of Columbia. The legislation now goes to Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who supports legalisation.\nThe bill was a top priority for Democrats, who framed legalisation as a necessary step to end the disparate treatment of people of colour under current marijuana laws. But talks between Democrats in the House and Senate grew tense in recent days, and a compromise version of the massive bill did not emerge publicly until late Saturday afternoon.\n\u201cIt's been a lot of work to get here, but I would say that we're on the path to an equitable law allowing responsible adults to use cannabis,\" said Sen. Adam Ebbin, the chief sponsor of the Senate bill. He said the compromise agreement is a good start.\nSeveral Democrats said they hoped Northam would send the legislation back to them with amendments, including speeding up the date for legalisation.\nUnder the legislation that passed, possession of up to an ounce (28.3 grams) of marijuana will become legal beginning January 1, 2024, at the same time sales will begin and regulations will go into effect to control the marijuana marketplace in Virginia.\nUnder a provision Senate Democrats insisted on, the legislation will include a reenactment clause that will require a second vote from the General Assembly, but only on the regulatory framework and criminal penalties for several offenses, including underage use and public consumption of marijuana. A second vote will not be required on legalisation.\nThe Senate had sought to legalise simple possession this year to immediately end punishments for people with small amounts of marijuana, but House Democrats argued that legalisation without a legal market for marijuana could promote the growth of the black market.\nLawmakers last year decriminalised marijuana, making simple possession a civil penalty that can be punished by a fine of no more than USD 25.\nThe three-year delay in legalising simple possession drew sharp criticism from some lawmakers, as well as the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, Marijuana Justice and other racial justice advocacy groups.\n\u201cThis bill does not advance the cause of equal justice or racial justice in Virginia. It is the product of a closed-door legislative process that has prioritized the interests of recreational marijuana smokers over people and communities of colour,\u201d the groups said in a statement before the vote.\nGroups that opposed legalisation entirely have said they are concerned that it could result in an increase in drug-impaired driving crashes and the use of marijuana among youth.\nRepublican lawmakers spoke against the measure Saturday night, saying such a critical issue deserved a less rushed approach.\n\"I would say there are not more than two or three members of this body that have a clue about the comprehensiveness of what this bill does,\" said Senate Minority Leader Tommy Norment.","89":"Myanmar security forces violently dispersed anti-coup rallies around the country on Sunday, with reports of at least three protesters killed in the crackdown.\nThe junta has ratcheted up its use of force over the weekend against the massive street movement demanding it yield power and release ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\nPolice and soldiers had already fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannon on demonstrations in recent weeks in an effort to bring the civil disobedience campaign to heel, with live rounds used in some isolated cases.\nLarge numbers were again mobilised on Sunday morning to scatter building crowds in several parts of the country that had gathered in response to online calls for protesters to once again flood the streets.\nThree men were killed and at least 20 others injured when security forces moved on a rally in the southern coastal hub of Dawei, according to a volunteer medic and local media reports.\nRead: More protests against coup planned in Myanmar after hundreds arrested\nPyae Zaw Hein, a rescue worker, told AFP the trio had been \"shot dead with live rounds\", while the injured had been hit by rubber bullets.\n\"There could be many more casualties as well because more wounded people keep coming in,\" he added.\nLocal media outlet Dawei Watch confirmed that three had died in the incident.\nOfficers in the commercial hub Yangon began dispersing one crowd in the downtown area minutes before the slated beginning of the day's protest, but it was unclear whether they used live rounds.\n\"Police started shooting just as we arrived,\" said Amy Kyaw, a 29-year-old primary school teacher in a downtown Yangon neighbourhood.\nRead: Deaths reported in Myanmar as anti-coup crackdown heats up\n\"They didn't say a word of warning.

But these hardy little balls contain acacia seeds that are helping regrow Kenya's depleted forests.\nIn a tranche of razed forest bordering the Masai Mara wildlife reserve, a team of rangers scatter generous handfuls of \"seedballs\" around the bald clearing to give nature a fighting chance to regenerate.\nIt takes just minutes for the eight rangers from the Mara Elephant Project, a conservation group, to toss some 22,000 seedballs across this ravaged corner of the Nyakweri forest.\n\"It is very simple,\" said Jackson Maitai, whose rangers discovered that loggers had illegally cleared this land during their routine patrols to protect elephants in the area.\n\"The seedballs are not actually heavy. We just throw them away everywhere we see there is deforestation, so it is not a big deal.\"\nHumble though they may be, seedballs are tackling a century-old problem in Kenya.\nTrees were felled en masse by colonial administrators to fuel a train across East Africa, while land today is cleared for agriculture and charcoal production as Kenya's population grows upward and outward.\nThe forests bordering the Masai Mara, the legendary wildlife haven and savannah wilderness in the country's southwest, are no exception, chipped away for pasture, crops and charcoal, a cheap fuel.\nNyakweri, for example, has lost more than 50 per cent of its forest cover in the past two decades, reducing key habitats for wild animals, according to Marc Goss, the director of the Mara Elephant Project.\nBut forests, which cover just seven percent of Kenya's land mass, also act as water reserves and a powerful bulwark against climate change and desertification.\nKenya's forests are cleared at a rate of 5,000 hectares (12,300 acres) a year, the environment ministry said in 2018.\nFor three years, Goss and his team have been giving nature a helping hand by scattering seedballs by any means possible -- on foot, by car and even dropped by helicopter.\nDeveloped by Seedballs Kenya, the casing of charcoal dust protects the seed inside from being eaten by mice, birds or insects before it germinates. The shell is semi-porous, giving it a fighting chance even in arid conditions.\n\"You can throw them out year round. It would sit there, wait for the rain to come, it washes the dust away, and then the seed is back to its natural state, and will be able to start growing,\" said Teddy Kinyanjui, the co-founder of Seedballs Kenya.\nThe idea is not entirely new: in ancient Egypt, seeds were coated in mud to protect them from the elements and hungry passersby, Kinyanjui said.\nBut instead of mud, the innovation in Kenya is using cheap, abundant charcoal dust to forge their own casing.\nThe dust used to compound the pellets is a byproduct of the charcoal industry, which itself is a driver of deforestation, with felled trees slow-heated in kilns to produce the popular and inexpensive fuel.\n\"It is kind of a closed loop cycle,\" Kinyanjui said.\nSeedballs only contain indigenous species, mainly varieties of acacias, the classic tree of the East African savannah, but one much sought-after and felled for the quality of its wood.\nIn Kenya, seedballs are purchased by smallholder farmers wanting a cheap way to green their land and major buyers donating 500 kilogrammes (1,100 pounds) at a time to groups working in reforestation, like the Mara Elephant Project.\nSeedballs Kenya, which reinvests its profits, also works with hotels offering tourists a \"reforestation\" experience to accompany the traditional safari.\nThe company has sold 13 million seedballs since launching in mid-2016.\nOf those thrown into the wild, only a small number -- somewhere in the five to 10 per cent range -- have actually yielded a shoot.\nThe germination rate is low and some seeds can hibernate for years -- making visible gains long in the making, Kinyanjui said.\n\"Trees are slow, especially in these days where everything is Instagram and quick quick quick,\" Kinyanjui said.\n\"Telling people to wait three years, or whatever, that's a very hard thing.\"","91":"Education budgets were cut by 65 per cent of low and lower-middle income countries after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic while only 33 per cent of high and upper-middle income countries did so, according to a report by the World Bank.\nThe report, compiled in collaboration with UNESCO's Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, said the current levels of government spending in low and lower-middle income countries fall short of those required to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\"In order to understand the short-term impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on education budgets, information was collected for a sample of 29 countries across all regions. The sample represents about 54 per cent of the world's school and university aged population. The information collected was then verified with World Bank country teams,\" the report said.\n\"Responding to the Covid-19 crisis requires additional spending to adapt schools for compliance with the necessary measures to control contagion and to fund programs to make up for the losses in learning students experienced while schools were closed,\" it added.\nThe sample includes three low-income countries (Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Uganda); 14 lower-middle income countries (Bangladesh, Egypt, India, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Tanzania, Ukraine, Uzbekistan); 10 upper-middle income nations (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Jordan, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Peru, Russia, Turkey); and two high-income countries (Chile, Panama).\n\"The following countries have education shares below 10 per cent and therefore are likely to have other main financing sources besides budget assigned by the central government: Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Russia,\" the report stated.\n\"It is not clear that countries that have seen a decline in their education budget will be able to cover these costs increased during the pandemic alongside the regular increases in funding needed to support growing school-age populations.\n\"Despite the urgent need for adequate funding to allow school systems to reopen safely, about half of the countries in the sample cut their education budgets. This scarcely bodes well for the future, when macroeconomic conditions are expected to worsen,\" it said.\nOn the other hand, households in low and lower-middle income countries tend to contribute a greater share of the total education spending than those in upper-middle and high-income countries, the report pointed out.\n\"While data is limited, household education spending as a share of GDP has increased in low-income countries and households still contribute significantly to the costs of education.

A healthy economy brings a measure of stability, while instability has often undermined the strength of the oil sector. Decades of wars, civil unrest and invasion have stalled production.\nFollowing low oil prices dragged down by the coronavirus pandemic and international disputes, Iraq is showing signs of recovery, with January exports reaching 2.868 million barrels per day at USD 53 per barrel, according to Oil Ministry statistics.\nTo most Iraqis, the industry can be summed up by those figures, but Amjad and Rawthan have a more granular view. Every well presents a set of challenges; some required more pressure to pump, others were laden with poisonous gas. \u201cEvery field feels like going to a new country,\u201d said Amjad.\nGiven the industry's outsized importance to the economy, petrochemical programmes in the country's engineering schools are reserved for students with the highest marks. Both women were in the top 5 per cent of their graduating class at Basra University in 2018.\nIn school they became awestruck by drilling. To them it was a new world, with it's own language: \u201cspudding\u201d was to start drilling operations, a \u201cChristmas tree\u201d was the very top of a wellhead, and \u201cdope\u201d just meant grease.\nEvery work day plunges them deep into the mysterious affairs below the Earth's crust, where they use tools to look at formations of minerals and mud, until the precious oil is found. \u201cLike throwing a rock into water and studying the ripples,\u201d explained Rawthan.\nTo work in the field, Amjad, the daughter of two doctors, knew she had to land a job with an international oil company \u2014 and to do that, she would have to stand out. State-run enterprises were a dead end; there, she would be relegated to office work.\n\u201cIn my free time, on my vacations, days off I was booking trainings, signing up for any programme I could,\u201d said Amjad.\nWhen China's CPECC came to look for new hires, she was the obvious choice. Later, when Texas-based Schlumberger sought wireline engineers she jumped at the chance. The job requires her to determine how much oil is recoverable from a given well. She passed one difficult exam after another to get to the final interview.\nAsked if she was certain she could do the job, she said: \u201cHire me, watch.\u201d In two months she traded her green hard hat for a shiny white one, signifying her status as supervisor, no longer a trainee \u2014 a month quicker than is typical.\nRawthan, too, knew she would have to work extra hard to succeed. Once, when her team had to perform a rare \u201csidetrack\u201d \u2014 drilling another bore next to the original \u2014 she stayed awake all night.\n\u201cI didn't sleep for 24 hours, I wanted to understand the whole process, all the tools, from beginning to end,\" she said.\nRawthan also now works for Schlumberger, where she collects data from wells used to determine the drilling path later on. She wants to master drilling, and the company is a global leader in the service.\nRelatives, friends and even teachers were discouraging: What about the hard physical work? The scorching Basra heat? Living at the rig site for months at a time? And the desert scorpions that roam the reservoirs at night?\n\u201cMany times my professors and peers laughed, Sure, we'll see you out there,' telling me I wouldn't be able to make it,\u201d said Rawthan. \u201cBut this only pushed me harder.\u201d\nTheir parents were supportive, though. Rawthan's mother is a civil engineer and her father, the captain of an oil tanker who often spent months at sea.\n\u201cThey understand why this is my passion,\u201d she said. She hopes to help establish a union to bring like-minded Iraqi female engineers together. For now, none exists.\nThe work is not without danger. Protests outside oil fields led by angry local tribes and the unemployed can disrupt work and sometimes escalate into violence toward oil workers. Confronted every day by flare stacks that point to Iraq's obvious oil wealth, others decry state corruption, poor service delivery and joblessness.\nBut the women are willing to take on these hardships. Amjad barely has time to even consider them: It was 11 p.m., and she was needed back at work.\n\u201cDrilling never stops,\u201d she said.

In the first instance, Lindsey Boylan, a former economic-development aide, accused Cuomo in a Medium post of giving her an unwanted kiss, inviting her to play strip poker on a taxpayer-funded flight, and other abuse that led her to quit her job.\nRead: New York Governor Andrew Cuomo calls for outside review after second former aide alleges sexual misconduct\nOn Saturday, a second former aide accused Cuomo of harassment, according to the New York Times. Charlotte Bennett, a former health policy adviser, said Cuomo had asked her questions about her sex life and made what she interpreted as sexual overtures. Bennett didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment from Bloomberg News.\nCuomo has denied his call to Assemblyman Ron Kim was threatening, and rejected the harassment allegations as false. Four other state officials who flew with Cuomo when Boylan was present issued a statement through Cuomo\u2019s office saying no such conversation happened.\nIn a statement on Saturday, Cuomo said he had \u201ctried to be supportive and helpful\u201d when Bennett \u201copened up about being a sexual assault survivor.\u201d Cuomo called for \u201ca full and thorough outside review.\u201d A former federal judge has been named to lead that process.\nThe cascading incidents add to the political weight around Cuomo\u2019s neck. In a statement on Saturday, Republican Representative Elise Stefanik of New York called for Cuomo to resign.\nThe controversy for Cuomo, 63, comes after a long career that includes stints as a U.S. Cabinet official, state attorney general, and three terms as governor.\nThe reviews were glowing for Cuomo in the early months of the pandemic, for his must-see briefings and heated rebukes of then-President Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. The hashtag #PresidentCuomo was trending even as Joe Biden was struggling to campaign under pandemic restrictions.\nBut recently, State Attorney General Letitia James released a report on Jan. 28 alleging the Cuomo administration undercounted Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes by as much as 50%, and may have obscured data available to assess the risk to patients.\nThe state revealed that thousands of nursing-home deaths occurred in hospitals or outside the facilities, information that had been left out of state counts. More than 12,300 patients from New York nursing homes, assisted living, and adult care facilities have died since March 2020, according to Feb. 25 state data. Another 3,000 patients are presumed to have died of the disease, but their causes of death have not been confirmed.\nRead: Former aide says New York Governor Cuomo kissed her, suggested strip poker\nNew York trails only California for the total number of people who have died from coronavirus, with 46,000, but its current case rate per million residents is in the middle of U.S. states.\nNow Cuomo is facing intense questions over whether his administration\u2019s policies led to an unnecessary increase of virus deaths among elderly nursing home residents.\nRich Azzopardi, Cuomo\u2019s spokesman, rejected the criticism in an emailed statement.\n\u201cNew Yorkers know it was the governor who worked night and day to get them through the worst of this pandemic,\u201d Azzopardi said. \u201cFrom the strongest gun safety laws in the nation to a $15 minimum wage and free college tuition, he has a nationally significant record of progressive accomplishments that Washington is trying to match.\u201d\nStill, Democratic circles are already abuzz with talk about who might run against Cuomo in the 2022 primary, an unthinkable concept when he was topping the charts for his Covid response. There\u2019s no limit to the number of consecutive terms a New York governor may serve.\n\u2018Earned\u2019 Primary\nNew York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who\u2019s been approached to run against Cuomo in a primary, said he\u2019s been pretty explicit with his criticism of Cuomo\u2019s handling of the pandemic and his administration\u2019s performance.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve said, the governor has earned himself a primary for a number of reasons -- most of which we\u2019ve known about for a long time, but now the worst of the governor is coming out at a time when New Yorkers need the best of their government,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. Williams said he remains committed to his city post.\nHank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic consultant who worked on some of Cuomo\u2019s campaigns, called the governor\u2019s downfall \u201cShakespearean.\u201d\n\u201cThe compassionate new Andrew that was created suddenly became a fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very thing that made him the hero made him the villain.\u201d\nRead: Cuomo accused of sexual harassment by second former aide\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, when New York was the nation\u2019s Covid epicenter, Cuomo held daily briefings that were aired nationally. He shared data, he answered reporters\u2019 questions, he told stories about his family.\nLeadership Lessons\nThe briefings, a stark contrast to the tone and substance to those coming from Trump\u2019s White House, drew millions of viewers, earning him the nickname \u201cAmerica\u2019s Governor.\u201d\nIn October, Cuomo released a book offering leadership lessons from the pandemic, and held up New York\u2019s response as a national model. The next month, his televised briefings received an Emmy award.\nThat was premature, said New York state Senate Minority Leader Robert Ortt, a Republican.\n\u201cAs we learn more, I think history may tell a different story about this response and we may look at this years from now or even months from now and we may have a different view,\u201d Ortt said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the person who\u2019s winning in the first quarter, it\u2019s the person who\u2019s winning in the fourth quarter.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s job performance rating, which hit 63% at the height of the pandemic, has cooled to 56%, according to Siena College polls. A Marist poll released Feb. 23 showed approval of his handling of the pandemic had dropped to 54% from 72%, with a majority of voters saying Cuomo did something wrong in his handling of nursing homes.\n\u2018No Heart or Ears\u2019\nCritics have seized on the moment, even though the approval numbers are hardly fatal. Bills that attempt to strip Cuomo\u2019s emergency powers have failed to take hold as lawmakers worry about the fallout from revoking his authority.\nState Senator Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat who heads the health committee, said he and other lawmakers have long criticized the governor, especially for keeping his inner circle small and what he said was a focus on politics over policy. Rivera described the administration as \u201call brain and guts, and no heart or ears.\u201d\nSheinkopf said Cuomo\u2019s troubles show that the high-profile job of governor of New York -- the launching pad to the White House for four presidents, most recently Franklin D. Roosevelt -- has become too politically fraught to lead to higher office.\nThe last Democratic governor of New York who was considered a serious contender for the presidency was Cuomo\u2019s father, Mario, whose famous indecisiveness led him to not run in 1988 and 1992 and to later turn down a Supreme Court nomination that was a safe bet for confirmation.\nUltimate Survivor\nThe younger Cuomo seemed destined for big things as well, serving as secretary of Housing and Urban Development under President Bill Clinton, marrying a member of the Kennedy dynasty, and bouncing back from a failed bid for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2002 with a headline-making turn as attorney general.\nSince being elected governor in 2010, Cuomo has picked up critics among progressive Democrats by cutting deals with Republicans and working closely with a group that helped keep the state Senate in GOP hands from 2011 to 2019.\nStill, he\u2019s fought off challenges from the left before, including an attention-grabbing but ultimately lopsided primary contest with \u201cSex and the City\u201d actress Cynthia Nixon in 2018.\nBut while Sheinkopf said things look pretty bad for Cuomo now, he may still win a fourth term, a feat even his father couldn\u2019t pull off.\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked in American politics in 44 states, governors, congressmen, you name it,\u201d said Sheinkopf. \u201cIf anybody could survive this, it\u2019s Cuomo.\u201d","95":"Hong Kong police on Sunday detained 47 pro-democracy activists on charges of conspiracy to commit subversion under the city's national security law.\nThe former lawmakers and democracy advocates had been previously arrested in a sweeping police operation in January but were released.

DeFazio, D-Ore., said it will be up to the Biden administration and the House Ways and Means Committee to figure out how to pay for it.\nDeFazio said General Motors' recently announced goal of going largely electric by 2035 demonstrates the need for massive spending on charging stations across the country.

The number comes to 1 crore,\" he said. \"After the successful Ujjwala scheme, households without LPG are very less in India. We have around 29 crore households with LPG connections. With the one crore connections, we will be close to 100 per cent LPG penetration.\"\nHe, however, hastened to add that one crore unserved population was a dynamic number and there may be more families that may need LPG connections as they move to cities or other places for employment and other reasons.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's signature Ujjwala scheme for providing a free cooking gas connection to the poor had been lauded by the WHO in 2018 and by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in the following year as one that reduced indoor household pollution by helping families switch to cleaner energy sources and improving the environment and health of women.\nThe carbon footprint of LPG is 50 per cent lower than coal. LPG helps reduce carbon dioxide and black carbon emissions, which are the second-largest contributors to global warming.\nBefore Ujjwala, India was the second-largest contributor to global mortality due to household and ambient air pollution.\n\"We want to connect everyone in the country to the LPG network,\" Kapoor said. \"Besides Ujjwala, we are also easing out the procedure for getting LPG connections.\"\nWhile theoretically, the current rule is that everyone is eligible to get a cooking gas connection, practically it is difficult to get one due to requirements such as proof of residence of the place, where the connection is being sought.\n\"We have asked our oil companies that those kinds of complaints should be eliminated. A person who is even shifting from one city to another, even temporarily, should also be able to get an LPG connection without hassles. We want to move to a stage where with very basic documents, just some proof of identity, one can get an LPG connection,\" he said.\nRead | Revenue amid resentment: Why fuel prices are on a steady climb\nAs a step towards that, a unified software for all the three fuel marketing companies - Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum - is being prepared.\n\"We are getting a common information technology-based system in place.

We also want to popularise the mobile applications that our companies have so that no one has to keep a physical booklet,\" he said.\nThrough this software, inter-company migration will become very easy, he said, adding in cities a person would have a choice of seeking an LPG refill from three distributors of the same company.\nThe Ujjwala Yojana was launched in May 2016 with a target to give free LPG connections to 5 crore mostly rural women members of below the poverty line (BPL) households. The list was later expanded to include all SC\/ST households and forest dwellers, among others.\nIn 2018, the scheme was extended to all poor households and the target raised to 8 crore connections.\nUnder the scheme, the government provides a subsidy of Rs 1,600 to state-owned fuel retailers for every free LPG gas connection that they give to poor households. This subsidy is intended to cover the security fee for the cylinder and the fitting charges.\nThe beneficiary has to buy her own cooking stove. To reduce the burden, the scheme allows beneficiaries to pay for the stove and the first refill in monthly instalments. However, the cost of all subsequent refills has to be borne by the beneficiary household.","165":"The Indian Secular Front (ISF), led by Abbas Siddiqui, on Sunday vowed to defeat the TMC and BJP in the upcoming assembly elections, asserting that people of the state would teach Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee \"a lesson for her arrogance\".\nProclaiming support for the Left Front and its allies in the state, Siddiqui said Bengal will get the better of the BJP and \"its B-team Mamata Banerjee\" in the polls.\n\"Mamata and her TMC has destroyed democracy and unleashed anarchy.

","190":"By Clara Ferreira Marques,\n\u201cThe vaccine works. It is safe, effective, and potent.\u201d\nIn 1955, those were the words that told the world US scientist Jonas Salk\u2019s polio shot was a success. It was news greeted with popular jubilation, ringing church bells and boldface banner headlines. The sort of heartfelt relief that most of us can readily identify with, more than a year into a coronavirus pandemic that has now killed 2.5 million people. \nIn an age when rich countries have largely forgotten the ravages of infectious disease, we have spent the past months grappling with the impact of a highly contagious illness that does not discriminate. We now hope our technological and medical advances can accomplish in months what it took decades to achieve in the past with poliovirus, smallpox or measles. As those rejoicing at Salk\u2019s victory soon found, the first vaccines are the end of the beginning \u2014 not quite the beginning of the end. \nCORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH\nThe two viruses are very different. Poliomyelitis is primarily spread through contact and infected faecal matter, while Covid-19 is usually transmitted through respiratory droplets. The first tends to affect young children, and can invade the nervous system. The second appears to hit the elderly hardest. Polio has triggered no pandemics, no economic crashes. Yet the large-scale campaign against what was once called infantile paralysis, and the fear that preceded it, is arguably the closest precedent to today\u2019s effort.\nThere\u2019s good news in that. Past inoculation successes are reminders of what is possible: We know that vaccination works. There were also painful mistakes that stand as salutary reminders for modern policy makers that ending viral nightmares requires sound judgment, investment and trust. \nRecords of polio cases date back centuries, perhaps as far back as ancient Egypt, but epidemics only became a serious scourge in Europe and the United States as the last century dawned. The first recognised US outbreak was in Vermont in 1894. Others followed. In 1916, a devastating summer in New York brought death, lockdowns, anti-immigrant prejudice and culls of cats. It left a trail of dread. The annual number of US cases peaked in 1952 at nearly 60,000.\nAlso read: All you need to know about Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine authorised in US\nMany more children died in accidents or from cancer over these years, but panic was widespread. Images of patients in iron lungs, huge metal chambers designed to help patients breathe, terrified. So did young children in leg braces. By the 1950s, the only thing Americans feared more than polio was the nuclear bomb.\nEnding that took a crusade. President Franklin Roosevelt, who contracted polio in 1921, helped turn a rehabilitation charity into an unprecedented national campaign that touched nearly every American, encouraging them to give just one coin for research. They did, sending them in such large numbers the White House could hardly cope. The March of Dimes began in 1938, transformed fundraising and collected hundreds of millions of dollars.\nThen, success. Salk got to the finish line first with an inactivated virus vaccine, earning him popular adulation, though not necessarily the respect of his peers. Albert Sabin, a bitter rival who developed a different, live virus oral vaccine approved a few years later, dismissed it as \u201ckitchen chemistry,\u201d arguing the University of Pittsburgh scientist had simply put together findings others had made. Still, thanks to both, cases plummeted.\nAlso read: Protein inherited by humans from Neanderthals linked to reduced Covid-19 severity: Study\nAfter a year or so of Covid-19, we have vaccine breakthroughs, but we\u2019re not yet near the finish line; eradication is distant. There are too many unanswered questions. We don\u2019t know enough about how immunity works after illness or vaccination, nor do we fully understand transmission. Cases go untraced. The goal of today\u2019s shots is to bring down mortality rates, and to keep health systems running. Children will not be immunized for months. Eventually, though, the target will shift. Victory will require mass and even routine inoculation while tackling significant scepticism.\nAs that happens, it\u2019s worth considering that the world has been here before. There are lessons to carry into the 21st century.\nAt the most basic level, it\u2019s clear that central government-led policy \u2014 leadership \u2014 is crucial at every stage, from supporting vaccine development to dissemination. The official decision to get behind polio inoculations didn\u2019t guarantee a cure, but without support would have taken far longer. So too with Covid-19. In the US, Operation Warp Speed, a $12 billion-plus effort to fund vaccines, was a rare bright spot in the Trump administration\u2019s otherwise dismal handling of the outbreak. Investment in manufacturing may have saved months. It\u2019s a pity so much time was wasted by the same officials, failing to plan adequately for the actual injections. \nA sound strategy will have to include insuring that even the least-affluent countries have the necessary healthcare structures, without which routine immunization, cold chains to preserve vaccines, timely testing, monitoring and oversight \u2014 the basics for control of Covid-19 and any subsequent viruses \u2014 will be impossible. It\u2019s a priority that has been neglected for too long already.\nWhile good governance helps, poor decisions create disproportionate and lasting damage. In the US campaign against polio, not unlike Covid-19, the first hiccup was dissemination. President Dwight Eisenhower\u2019s administration simply did not see distribution as its role. That was \u201csocialised medicine,\u201d opposed by the then secretary of health, education and welfare. One official quoted in David Oshinsky\u2019s \u201cPolio: An American Story\u201d suggested that an allocation program would \u201cconstitute an undesirable precedent.\u201d Shortages plagued the early years of the campaign, as did inequities in access at a time when US schools were only just being desegregated.\nBut what followed was worse. In the rush, inspection failures allowed tainted vaccines from one manufacturer, Cutter Laboratories, to get through and spread polio among children and their communities, leaving some 200 paralysed and 10 dead. The pause that followed meant more than 28,000 mostly avoidable cases were reported in 1955, Oshinsky writes. The incident and the obfuscating official statements around it caused deep misgivings and still fuel anti-vaxxers today. It ushered in far tighter regulation in the US and beyond, a boon. It also opened the floodgates to predatory litigation that kept large pharmaceutical firms away from vaccines, seen as high risk and low reward. \nAlso read: Single Pfizer vaccine dose strongly protects those who\u2019ve were infected with coronavirus, studies find\nTrust is vital to success. It\u2019s striking today to read accounts of a 1947 smallpox scare in New York during which, according to the city\u2019s health commissioner, some 6.4 million people were inoculated in less than a month, most within two weeks. That\u2019s spectacular compared to the current pace of Covid-19 vaccinations. Authorities at the city level were able to take decisions that might be impossible today, and there are questions on the exact figures. But a popular belief in science, clear messaging, and reports like that of President Harry Truman rolling up his sleeves helped stop the spread. In 1956, Elvis lent a hand in the polio fight when he was vaccinated on live television.\nRebuilding that confidence is tough, whether in politically polarized Western societies or regions like Pakistan and Afghanistan, where misinformation and threats have helped wild polio remain endemic. In 2003, rumours in northern Nigeria that polio vaccinations were contaminated with anti-fertility agents caused a devastating boycott. Five years later, the country accounted for nearly 90% of type one wild polio cases globally. Combating that means education and swift response to local concerns, especially in countries that may have competing priorities. Vaccine mistrust dates back centuries, but it\u2019s far more pernicious in the age of the internet. It requires presence in communities, where peers can answer questions and concerns.\nIt\u2019s vital, not just in developing nations, to get through to everyone with reason \u2014 not condescension, let alone coercion. There remains, to quote one British parliamentarian debating smallpox in 1807, the liberty of doing wrong.\nHistory tells us that the best vaccination efforts are built on collaboration and coordination. We know that the US and Soviet Union working together at the height of the Cold War was instrumental in testing the oral polio vaccine. In the 1960s, a Soviet freeze-drying technique helped provide smallpox vaccine doses for developing countries, supported financially by the US Later, a global effort helped dramatically reduce polio cases \u2014 and even that might have happened more easily if the emerging world hadn\u2019t been left to last, or cost had not dominated concerns for too long. The live vaccine has been crucial, but combined with poor inoculation practices has also led to a surge in vaccine-derived polio.\nWe\u2019ve seen over the past few months that fast action is possible with investment and commitment. Full victory is more elusive. Aidan O\u2019Leary, director for polio eradication at the World Health Organization, emphasised to me the importance of aiming not for coverage targets, but for zero cases. It\u2019s relatively easy to get to 50% or even 70% coverage, and soon Western economies will rebound \u2014 but the countdown to zero implies that not even the most vulnerable are missed, and that\u2019s tougher. It demands sustained investment and momentum.\nCoronavirus vaccine updates on DH\nThe smallpox vaccine was discovered in 1796. After a false start, an intensified WHO eradication plan got under way in 1967. There are questions about compulsion, but the illness was vanquished by 1980. Not all efforts have had similar success, because illnesses have been harder to control, vaccines not fully effective or governments stumbled. The economic impact and financial focus on Covid-19 suggests success is more likely than ever before. Learning lessons from history can make it a triumph for everyone.","191":"By Tara Lachapelle\n\"All that\u2019s required is the passage of time, an inner calm,\u201d began a sentence in Warren Buffett\u2019s annual letter to his followers Saturday. He was talking about the essentials of investing in a farm or business, but it felt like a metaphor for the collectively lonely and despairing moment that the world found itself in during the past year. With his own 90-year perspective, Buffett reminded his readers that a moment is all this is.\nThe bar was high for Buffett this time, given all that\u2019s happened since last year\u2019s letter: a public-health crisis; lockdowns; social unrest; worsening wealth inequality; a new US president; extreme political divisiveness that led to insurrectionists storming the Capitol; climate disasters such as the tragic freezing conditions and blackouts in Texas last week; the resurgence of Bitcoin; and the recent market tumult brought on in part by a boiling over of frustrations with the state of the world.\nDid he clear that bar? Perhaps that\u2019s the wrong question. Anyone looking to hear his thoughts on today\u2019s issues may feel let down \u2014 he didn\u2019t directly address any of them \u2014 but I doubt his devotees were surprised by this or disappointed. Buffett met the occasion by doing what he always does: explain his decisions, take his lumps and victory laps, offer up his musings on investing. If you wanted something different, you didn\u2019t get it, and you don\u2019t know Buffett.\nThe last time the chairman and chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. spoke publicly was at the virtual shareholder meeting in May, an uncharacteristically somber event at which he sat in an empty auditorium normally filled with his adoring fans and left listeners wondering whether he was still the Oracle of Omaha. New icons with investing philosophies arguably antithetical to the Buffett way have since filled the void, such as Tesla Inc. billionaire Elon Musk, futuristic stock picker Cathie Wood and so-called SPAC king Chamath Palihapitiya \u2014 especially as Berkshire\u2019s stock continues to lag the market.\nBut Buffett has his story and he\u2019s sticking to it. And as if to remind readers of exactly that, the letter takes time to recount the history of Berkshire and how it came to be: a state-by-state discovery of ordinary Americans building extraordinary businesses \u2014 See\u2019s Candies, Nebraska Furniture Market, Clayton Homes, Pilot Travel Centers \u2014 that Buffett and his now-97-year-old partner, Charlie Munger, couldn\u2019t help but acquire and continue to admire. Some are still run by descendants of the families that started them. If this were to be Buffett\u2019s last letter, it would be a relatively eloquent signoff. Here\u2019s a notable passage:\nThere has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America. Despite some severe interruptions, our country\u2019s economic progress has been breathtaking. Beyond that, we retain our constitutional aspiration of becoming \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d Progress on that front has been slow, uneven and often discouraging. We have, however, moved forward and will continue to do so. Our unwavering conclusion: Never bet against America.\nThere was no mention of Bitcoin, Robinhood or Reddit, but Buffett did write glowingly of \u201cthe million-plus\u201d individual investors who own Berkshire stock. He and Munger \u201cfeel a special obligation\u201d to this group because their earliest investors when they began managing money \u2014 before acquiring Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 \u2014 were just regular people. \u201cPartners\u201d is what they call Berkshire shareholders, and the company says it\u2019s happy with the partners it has, not needing to court Wall Street the way other publicly traded companies might. That Berkshire never holds earnings calls with analysts or attends investor conferences apart from its own annual event is the somewhat controversial proof.\nOn the topic of the Reddit day-trading phenomenon, Munger put it a bit differently this week, telling the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI hate this luring of people into engaging in speculative orgies.\u201d And while taking questions during the shareholder meeting Wednesday for Daily Journal Corp., which he chairs, Munger had choice words for SPACs, too. \u201cI think the world would be better off without them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's just that the investment banking profession will sell s--t as long as s--t can be sold.\u201d He is truly the yin to Buffett\u2019s yang.\nThe biggest omission from Buffett\u2019s letter was any rumination on markets and valuations, nor were there signs that maybe he\u2019d come to accept higher prices as the new normal. In fact, it seems to be just the opposite. Berkshire had to write down the value of its last major acquisition, Precision Castparts, by $11 billion. The aerospace-parts manufacturer was hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic as travel stopped. \u201cI paid too much for the company,\u201d he wrote. Doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s eager to make that mistake again.\nInstead, Berkshire has been buying back stock. Share repurchases tallied almost $25 billion in 2020. Speaking to his \u201cpartners,\u201d he wrote, \u201cThat action increased your ownership in all of Berkshire\u2019s businesses by 5.2%,\u201d and added that buybacks have continued since yearend. Last week, Berkshire also revealed large stakes in Chevron Corp. and Verizon Communications Inc. The company\u2019s cash stockpile \u2014 so large it has become part of Buffett folklore \u2014 did come down a tad last quarter to $138 billion.\n  The topic of succession didn\u2019t come up in Saturday\u2019s memo either, but Buffett did reveal that the virtual May meeting will be held not in Omaha as usual but in Los Angeles, where a wheelchair-bound Munger lives. Vice Chairmen Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, who have been given more authority in recent years, will also take part in the Q&A. Perhaps more succession news is in store.\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to listen to Buffett. Buffett doesn\u2019t have the energy to say what he said 30 and 40 years ago in 2021. And that\u2019s OK, he\u2019s earned the right to basically chill out and be the GOAT. But there has to be other folks that take that mantle, take the baton and do it as well to this younger generation in a language they understand.\u201d This was Palihapitiya speaking in a Bloomberg TV interview earlier this month.\nMaybe Buffett\u2019s style doesn\u2019t fit the current moment, but a moment is all it is. Value investing has cycled in and out of fashion, and as fad securities sold off this week, there\u2019s talk that it may be back \u201cin\u201d again. In any case, \u201cenergy\u201d isn\u2019t what earned Buffett his celebrity. It was patience, conviction, a sense of duty to his partners and a rejection of complex profit adjustments that are so often used to obscure and confuse. That philosophy should never go out of style.","192":"By Cathy O'Neil\nIn many ways, the tailored advertising that supports much of the internet works pretty well. It helps people with money figure out where to spend it with minimal effort and waste. But I\u2019m afraid it could lead to the extinction a certain kind of human: the informed consumer.\nThe early internet was pretty useless for finding stuff. I\u2019m an avid knitter, which is another way of saying that I collect yarn. I remember prospecting on the Alta Vista search engine in the mid-1990s, before Google: Most yarn stores didn\u2019t have websites, and even finding discussions was hard. The best resource for yarn stores back then was an actual book called the MilePost Guide \u2014 which, on my Alaskan honeymoon in 1997, took me and my shockingly patient new husband to every purveyor reachable by car.\nFast forward to now. Whenever I browse online, I\u2019m accosted by luxury sellers displaying sexy jewel-toned reams of yarn like NSFW porn. As much as I might struggle to ignore it, I am susceptible \u2014 as evidenced by all the impulse-buy inventory in my basement, in tones of burgundy, leaf green and turquoise. Yet I see and buy only certain types of yarn, produced by big companies with ample marketing budgets. It\u2019s like strolling through an endless mall filled with national chain stores, every third of which is Yankee Candles.\nSure, with some effort I can seek out something different. I can go to conventions and specialized websites in search of rare, local brands. But I\u2019m no longer as hungry for the yarn experience, in large part because it comes to me daily, sapping my volition. The overall experience is simultaneously convenient and lame, even as I feel utterly sated. I\u2019ve gone from a passionate investigator to a passive consumer.\nI recognize that my yarn experience is not among the world\u2019s great issues. Yet the phenomenon applies elsewhere, too. Consider financial services. I\u2019m in no hurry to revisit the sexist and racist lending practices of the 1950s. But as recently as the 1990s, I could and did visit several different banks to compare their offerings, which were pretty much standard for anyone who walked in the door. Now, if I go online, each bank will eyeball my credit and \u2014 while I\u2019m busy streaming Derry Girls \u2014 push out some tailored products designed to extract the maximum profit from me. I can\u2019t be an informed consumer, because I see only what they choose to show me. Instead of doing due diligence, I\u2019m getting profiled and managed.\nAnother consequential example is the job market. As the economy recovers from the pandemic, people will be searching for work largely online. The main job sites \u2014 such as LinkedIn, Indeed and Monster \u2014 make money by finding the best matches between employer and candidate. This means the platforms will optimize by showing people the jobs that people like them have proven most likely to get, as opposed to the jobs they might actually want. Aside from the obvious risk of illegal discrimination. this will have the effect of limiting people\u2019s ambitions, since they might never see the more highly paid positions that, although harder to get, might be within reach.\nAgain, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible to bypass the targeting. Savvy job seekers who push past the first few pages of listings might find that diamond in the rough. But I fear that by making things too easy, the age of automation might be allowing some of our most valuable skills to atrophy.","193":"Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri got off to a great start in the third round but ended with a bogey to be placed tied 43rd at the PGA TOUR's Puerto Rico Open at the windy Grand Reserve here.\nLahiri shot one-under 71 and was four-under 212 for 54 holes.\nLahiri, who had an eagle on the 18th on the first day, made a second eagle on the second hole on the third day.

Welcome! You have just hit a training plateau. Rather than throwing in the towel and calling it a day on your fitness regime, now is when you need to take your training up a notch and do things a little differently to continue to see progress.\nA training plateau is when you stop seeing progress despite doing all the \u201cright things\u201d which typically includes exercising regularly, eating right, and getting adequate rest. One usually hits a plateau when they continue to do the same activity over a period of time. This is because one of the goals of the human body is to conserve energy\/calories. When we perform a task for the first time, the body is not adequately equipped and ends up expending a lot of energy\/calories in order to perform the task (eg., lifting a heavy object off the ground). Over time if we continue to engage in the same activity, the body adapts (by building muscle in this example) in order to perform that activity with less effort and also conserves calories. However, the body develops lean muscle only to the point that is absolutely required and no more. This would be your point of a plateau if you continue to place the same demand on your body. Further, if the demand on the body is reduced over time, the body\u2019s response to this would be to get rid of that lean muscle, since it is no longer required.\nHow do you break through the plateau and continue to see progress?\nMix it up: Given that one of the primary goals of the body is to conserve calories, one of the ways the body goes about achieving this is by becoming more efficient. Therefore, if we place the same demand on the body, over time the body becomes more and more efficient and the marginal gains from the activity\/workout start to reduce. Shocking the body by doing different activities on a regular basis is one of the best ways to overcome this hurdle.\nUse the principle of progressive overload: Simply put, this principle basically says that over time, the intensity of your training needs to increase in order to continue to see progress. Intensity can be manipulated in the following ways \u2014 lift heavier weights, do more repetitions, take shorter breaks between exercises, increase the overall volume of exercises performed, etc.\nAdjust your diet: The body can also become quite efficient over time with the number of calories it burns. As we start to lose weight, the body starts to need a lesser number of calories simply because there is just less of you! Therefore, adjusting your calorie intake in line with your weight loss is important in order for one to continue to see change.\nRest: Rather than worrying about overtraining, what you should really be concerned with is under-recovering. Post-training, while the body is at rest is when adaptations take place. Without appropriate rest, we are overstressing our body and this is counterproductive to our goals. Remember, we only progress from the point of recovery.\nIn conclusion, when you are at a higher body fat percentage, or just getting started with training, you can make a lot of progress quickly due to there being more to lose, or more gains to be made. As you start to make progress, fine-tune your training programme by mixing it up and making it more challenging for you to see consistent improvement in your body and fitness.\n(The author has over a decade of experience in the fitness industry.

PHOTOS BY AUTHOR","197":"Despite the unrest in Kashmir, youngsters try to succeed in various fields but some young boys and girls are being deprived of a deep sense of freedom \u2014 the right to access education. Hundreds of pellet gun victims in Kashmir face a gloomy future as these young people have been blinded \u2014 either partially or completely by the pellets hit by the troops. These shotguns have resulted in serious injuries to the eyes that dreamt of a bright future.\nThe unfortunate occurrences have put a halt on the future endeavours of the victims and robbed them of their dreams to pursue their goals. They were forced to leave their schools as no such Braille system is prevalent in Kashmir except for a few schools in the city catering to children with special needs. It has not only affected their education but they\u2019re also left with no prospects of marriage. The deep sense of non-acceptance is so familiar with them as they\u2019re often cold-shouldered by society. To their dismay, most of the survivors are struggling to cope with this reversal of fortune, particularly when they are left with no medium for schooling.\nNightmarish\nUrfee, 20, from Chattergam Kalan, Shopian, is a creative designer who used to outshine in all the co-curricular activities at her school until fate jeopardised her plans. \u201cThat day was a nightmare. Whenever I recall that moment, it sends shivers down my spine. Being fond of knitting, I was weaving a sweater in the yard of my home when suddenly the forces started chasing a bunch of local stone pelters and resorted to aimless firing of pellet shotguns and it hit my eyes. In a blink of an eye, my dream of becoming a fine artist was blinded. There\u2019s no mode of literacy for me now.\u201d\nIn the corner of a small room in the outskirts of Pulwama lies Shakir, another victim of the brutalities of pellets. A passionate cricketer and an ardent gym rat, Shakir was known as a fitness fanatic in the locality. In 2016, Shakir was preparing for his exams, when he was injured by pellets causing grievous injuries to his left eye. The series of misfortunes didn\u2019t end here. To add to his woes, he was again hit by pellets in 2019, thus visually impairing him completely. Being fully deprived of sight, Shakir struggles to meet his day\u2013to\u2013day needs. While narrating his ordeal, Shakir murmured, \u201cI crave to see my family and friends. What hurts the most is that I have been made familiar with the dark reality that I\u2019ll never be able to see the hues of this colourful world again. It\u2019s difficult to navigate this world with no vision. All I can see is darkness and not even a single ray of light. I can\u2019t even study using tactile sign language. Now my entire life is confined to the four walls of my room.\u201d\nHaving earned the sobriquet of \u2018History Buzz,\u2019 Uzma would do her best to keep up to the name. Keen on reading political history books, Uzma would spend most of her time in her compact study room. Till the time when her dreams were smashed to smithereens. Harking back to the ill-starred happenings of the day, she narrates: \u201cI was reading at that time when I heard some Army men bawling \u201cStop\u201d from outside. I peeped through my window and suddenly some little things pierced my eyeballs. I started crying and screaming in pain. I could never turn back to my study from that day onwards. I could never resume reading again.\u201d\nAn oversight\nA ninth-standard student, Aasif is another hapless victim of the cruelty of pellet buckshot. \u201cIt was the holy month of Ramadan, I was observing a fast and went out to get milk from the local shop when those tiny pieces of lead got embedded into my eyes. Spending a life of pain while dealing with a disability is very challenging. But our sufferings are being oversighted and our lives do not matter at all.\u201d\nThe inaccessibility of Braille system in Kashmir stands as evidence for dereliction of duty for failing to even provide such victims a basic equitable resource of schooling.\nThese young people continue to live in a state of unabated darkness. Neither any infrastructure nor any printing units and sufficient study material are available for them. Even in the city, most of the government-run Braille presses are either non-functional or underutilised. Very few electronic manuscripts for Braille printing processes are prevalent. Such glitches have far-reaching consequences as the youth, despite being tech-savvy, have little or no training in Braille.\nA lack of Braille resources for pellet victims is a collective failure of humankind and the Braille literacy crisis in Kashmir is categorically alarming.","198":"A group of women in Kumaon are quietly seeding a revolution. They are battling the impending disaster of climate change in the most surprising of ways. By going back to traditional ways, they are making their lands, their produce, and in turn, their lives climate-resilient. They are growing traditional millets, lentils and vegetables in a mixed cropping manner. They have insured themselves against fluctuations in temperature, rainfall, snow and even labour availability. These women\u2019s groups in Okhalkanda block of Nainital district and Dhaula Devi block of Almora district in Uttarakhand have ensured their food and nutrition security by making diverse food available at different times of the year. In the process, they have demonstrated that it is possible to work the land in an ecologically sustainable way and make it more economically viable.\nWhen one looks around, it is hard not to feel overwhelmed by the major crises that are looming. Changing climate, drastically depleting water resources, nearly unbreathable air in many cities and towns and an exploding youth population, to name a few. What is easy to overlook are the pockets of change tiding over all the impediments and ensuring strong and sustainable communities. How can we engage with these communities? Beyond that, what is our role in being a part of, or creating such communities ourselves and helping them proliferate?\nSustainability is not just a word\nLooking at a few \u2018big\u2019 issues, let us start with our planet and its resources. Sustainability is a word that is thrown around a lot. So I turned to a sustainability expert\u2019. Gayatri Chauhan has demystified the concept through the group Buzz on Earth that she has set up. Behaviour change of key stakeholders is central to the success of any change movement, and there are both successes and failures on that front. \nAnti-smoking campaigns, better sanitation and safe water access have done well. Urban waste management or decongestion of cities have fared poorly. Ms Chauhan has successfully dealt with behaviour change in multiple settings. She says, \u201cWhile leading the sustainability agenda at an IT giant, I learnt how deeply businesses can impact the environment via their day-to-day decisions, and likewise, how much the environment can impact a business.\u201d Business and the environment are inextricably intertwined! This cyclical nature of the environment\u2019s impact on businesses and business\u2019 impact on the environment is often overlooked. \n\u201cSustainability can become a mainstream mantra only by converting naysayers into believers, prompting believers into taking effective action, and recognising and empowering those who take action. We run initiatives that handhold believers to engage in meaningful action. Mission Prakriti, a social forestry initiative, is one such example and a collaborative model between BuzzOnEarth, communities and corporates. India Model United Nations, a pan-India initiative to empower India\u2019s youth in solving sustainability challenges, is another,\u201d she says.\nMs Chauhan, while at a leading business school in the country, saw a lack of understanding around sustainability. \u201cWhenever I introduced myself as a sustainability professional, almost everyone would ask, \u201cwhat exactly is sustainability\u201d? That led me to think that if this is the level of awareness among the most well-read lot of the nation, there was something definitely lacking.\u201d That inspired her to do something to bridge this awareness gap, which she is doing through her organisation. \nWhy not a counter-intuitive idea?\nAir and water are on top of the mind when one thinks of sustainability. A city like Bengaluru is already reeling from depleting drinking water. Garvita Gulhati and her friends at Why Waste initiated the #GlassHalfFull movement. What started with a handful of restaurants in Bengaluru has now reached five lakh restaurants across the country and several more across the globe. This counter-intuitive idea of filling glass cups only halfway has saved over six million litres of water and reached over 10 million people. It has spread to eight countries across the world. Now, #GlassHalfFull is living a life of its own, being adopted by people across the world in their own ways and environments. Ms Gulhati, a Bengaluru student, says, it\u2019s simply overwhelming to see people making this movement their own. \nTap the aspirations of the young\nYoung people, urban or rural, are smarter, dare to dream, think outside the box and are techno-savvy. \u201cGirls, particularly, are more aspirational and want and are willing to break the mould,\u201d says Sunanda Mane of Lend-A-Hand India that works extensively with young people. The youth are impatient for results, which can be a positive trait. Their lifestyles are trendy, they respect age and experience, but are not bogged down by lack of experience. \u201cThese are the observations gleaned from a cross-section of young people we came across in the 14-18 years\u2019 age bracket,\u201d adds Sunanda.\nParents, on a positive note, are supportive of the dreams and aspirations and acknowledge their endeavours outside the academic world. The age gap also appears to be blurring and many parents are more like friends and are even learning from their digital-savvy children.\nConnecting with the outside world, digital gadgets, staying trendy \u2014 from hairstyle to clothes and shoes \u2014 access, building a rapport with influential people, and schooling with reasonable performance are the tools of their success. Many of the young are ready to work extra, are awed by the powerful in the communities around them and strive to stay connected with them. Many unfortunately also voice that nepotism is rampant and therefore is a way of life.   \n\u201cWe see great hope and a bright future for young people across the board. Better access, improvised curriculum, skilling, and technology are contributing in a big way,\u201d adds Raj Gilda, the other founder of Lend-A-Hand India. Many 17- and 18-year-olds are on the way to become entrepreneurs, starting their own hydroponic labs, a boutique cafe to supply birthday cakes, running a plant nursery and so on.\nChandra Kumar of Kaamanakerehundi, Mysore Taluk, whom I met recently, exemplifies this entrepreneurial spirit. Coming from a farming family, he wants to pursue horticulture and agro-forestry, and in the process, encourage fellow youth to stay back in their communities. \u201cWe want to develop the areas, make them productive and create a positive cycle for everyone,\u201d he says. He has burnt his fingers twice with his earlier entrepreneurial ventures. But he is not the one to give up. Such is the prevalent entrepreneurial spirit.\nSeek solutions, prepare for change\nRavi Venkatesan has spent a lot of time deliberating on the tools for success in the 21st century. Currently the founder of the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship (GAME), he has gained deep insights into the how-tos of success. \u201cThe defining skill for success in the 21st century is not something like coding, but rather the ability to solve problems and lead change,\u201d says Venkatesan.\nThis was true even before Covid-19, when the world was going through an extraordinary rate of change. What Covid-19 has done is magnified this pace. What is driving this rate of change? The first is technology, but the other one is changing beliefs and ideas about everything, the way we think about identity, globalisation, justice, sustainability, who gets to make the rules by which we run the world. Everything is in flux and therefore we are living in a world, which is very fluid. In fact, sociologists often use the term \u2018liquid modernity\u2019 and change is the only permanence and uncertainty is the only certainty in the world today.\nThis kind of fluidity impacts everyone, but it disproportionately impacts young people. So, how do you prepare yourself for a world that is changing in such dramatic ways, and more importantly, what will it take in terms of mindset and skillset to flourish in the 21st century? It all boils down to these three things. First of these, what people call agency or self-determination. \u201cDon\u2019t be a victim, no matter where you are born, may be you are born as a girl in Afghanistan or born in war-torn Syria, really a desperate place. Even there how do you get to see yourself as having some amount of influence over your destiny and having the self-confidence to act on it,\u201d asks Venkatesan who is also UNICEF\u2019s Special Representative for Young People and Innovation. Two is the mindset. If you want to succeed in the 21st century, you have to approach everything like an explorer who is seeing life as an adventure.\nPsychologists have unpacked this in more precise ways and talk about the need to have a growth mindset as opposed to a fixed mindset. Three is the skill to lead people and to solve complex problems.\nThese three things can neither be learnt online nor in a classroom! The only way is experiential. That is, more specifically, by tackling problems, progressively complicated challenges, and problems, wherever you are, in your school or college, or in the community in which you live. As you get more sophisticated, you can collaborate with other people all around the world using global network and technology to solve global-scale problems. Think about these challenges as a crucible for leadership development.\nSnail-paced progress yes...\nIf you look at all the major and existential problems, it is becoming clear that we are making snail-paced progress towards solving them, despite having technology, resources and talent. The core issue is leadership and this is where we need a whole new paradigm where we stop looking to people with formal authority, title, power and wealth to come to our rescue. Leadership for these problems must come from anywhere, everywhere and most of all from young people.\nOur greatest hope for humanity is to see how we can engage 1.8 billion young people around the world and make this the greatest army of problem solvers, changemakers, and leaders the world has ever seen.\n...but can we all do our bit?\nHealthcare, the ageing population and the issues of the elderly, job-creation at scale, human-wildlife conflict \u2014 the problems are umpteen. As we try to shrug off the Covid slump and look to the way ahead, what should be our mindset? What actions can we take in our respective worlds? Linear and simplistic responses to complex problems can rarely lead us to solutions. It takes empathy, ingenuity and resourcefulness to address these issues. Differences should be accepted and embraced.\nModelling behaviour from those in positions of influence, power and high visibility has a significant impact. At the same time, successful leaders at any scale have shown that it is critical to take the community along. They also spur collective action and continue to strive till systems are changed, not stopping at surface-level actions.\nNow, back to the women of Kumaon. They continue to nurture traditional crops with long roots, which help hold the soil together, are less water-dependent, sturdier, as they can tolerate long dry spells. Returning to completely organic methods of farming have helped them retain soil moisture, amongst other things. They have thoughtfully taken care of their forests too, reviving mixed broad-leaved forest species. This prevents soil erosion and landslides and improves water availability in the forests. All this forest management is being done as a community.\nClimatic variability has been pre-empted by changing cropping and land-use pattern by engaging in multi-tier cropping, above the soil, below the soil with plants of different heights. This optimises labour input, land and water use besides other advantages, impacted by climatic variability. Community-managed seed banks have helped with the revival of diverse seed varieties of traditional crops. These women have defied the negative impact of climate change and have taken their destiny into their own hands.\nAs climate resilience and food security researcher Reetu Sogani so eloquently put it, \u201cOrdinary women found strength in each other and fought social evils, starting from their homes. They have stemmed the threat to their lands and in turn, the planet, using their farming knowledge and wisdom for a climate-resilient hill community.\u201d They have shown that all of us can do it, no matter which community we are a part of.\nHere\u2019s to a post-pandemic solutions\u2019 oriented world!\nThe author is a social entrepreneur and a cross-sector partnership builder.

It was 66% effective in Latin America overall, which involved nearly 18,000 people in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru.\nDemographics\nAbout 34% of trial participants were over age 60.\n17.2% of participants in the trial were Black, 8.3% were American Indian or Alaskan Native, 2.5% were Asian and 45% were Hispanic or Latino.\nSide effects\nThe FDA said the most common reactions were injection site pain at 48.6%, headache at 39%, fatigue at 38.2% and aches and pains at 33.2%. Other side effects included a fever in 9% of participants and a high fever in 0.2% of those who received the vaccine.\nHow does it differ from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines?\nThe Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use new messenger RNA technology to create an immune response and both require two shots. The one-shot J&J vaccine involves a more conventional approach, using a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells to trigger an immune response.\nAlso read: Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine effective against Covid-19\nJ&J's vaccine remains stable for at least three months at normal refrigerator temperatures, while the Moderna vaccine must be shipped frozen and the Pfizer\/BioNTech option must be shipped and stored at even colder sub-Arctic temperatures.\nThese factors make it easier to vaccinate larger numbers of people, even in areas with poor transportation and storage infrastructure.\nPfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were about 94%-95% effective in trials conducted in the United States where variants were not circulating.\nHow does it rank next to the others?\nBoth mRNA vaccines showed higher efficacy rates in their trials than J&J's vaccine, but experts cautioned against drawing too much of a distinction between the vaccines because the trials had different endpoints and J&J's was conducted while highly transmissible new variants of the virus were circulating.\nCORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH\nNovavax Inc, which is testing its vaccine in South Africa, said it was 60% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe Covid-19 in patients who did not have HIV. It said about 90% of cases in the study involved the new South African variant. The mid-stage South Africa trial included 4,400 patients.\nThe vaccine developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University provided only minimal protection against mild-to-moderate Covid-19 from the South African variant in a relatively small trial. There was no data yet on its effectiveness in preventing severe disease in people who were infected by the variant because the study involved mostly young adults not considered to be at high risk for serious illness.\nSupply deals\nJ&J expects to produce at least a billion doses of its vaccine in 2021 and has signed supply deals for most of that.\nThe United States agreed to pay over $1 billion for 100 million doses and may purchase an additional 200 million doses.\nOther deals include 22 million doses for Mexico, 9 million for Colombia, 30 million the UK, 4 million to South Korea and 400 million for the European Union. It plans to supply 500 million to poorer countries, working with the Covax alliance.","200":"Fans have been flocking by the thousands to the Top Shot online platform to buy short videos of dramatic sequences from professional basketball games, as a new virtual market enjoys astonishing success among collectors, sports fans and art lovers.\nTo the untrained observer, one video clip showed NBA superstar LeBron James in one of his more spectacular moves; but it lasted no more than a few dozen seconds. On Top Shot, however, it instantly became a collector's item that sold on Monday for an eye-popping $208,000.\nThe video sequence is an \"NFT\" -- a Non-Fungible Token -- a virtual object whose identity, authenticity and traceability are theoretically indisputable and tamper-proof, thanks to the same \"blockchain\" technology used to ensure the security of cryptocurrencies like the hugely popular bitcoin.\nLaunched in early October by Canadian firm Dapper Labs in partnership with the National Basketball Association, Top Shot allows customers to buy and sell these short video clips -- called \"moments\" -- at prices that vary depending on demand and rarity.\nDapper Labs selects and sells the clips, in numbers varying from one single copy to hundreds of identical \"moments.\" Once the sale is recorded on the platform, clips can change hands, from one collector to another, an unlimited number of times.\nDapper Labs takes a small commission from each sale, and a percentage is shared with the NBA and the players association.\nAfter a slow start, Top Shot's business has exploded since January, generating more than $200 million in transactions since the start of the year, according to a Dapper Labs spokeswoman.\nBy Wednesday, Top Shot was approaching its first 100,000 buyers, she added.\nThe Momentranks website, which says it provides \"accurate, real-time moment valuations,\" puts the current value of the market at $1.8 billion.\nParadoxically, most of the video clips being sold can be viewed for free elsewhere on the internet, primarily on YouTube.\n\"I totally understand the initial reaction of 'I don't get it' or 'This seems stupid,'\" Jonathan Bales, who spent $35,000 for one \"moment,\" wrote on his Lucky Maverick blog.\n\"But guess what? There's a whole generation of young, smart people who've grown up in a fundamentally different way from me and you, so whether or not we 'get' the future is irrelevant to how it will transpire.\"\nSteve Poland, creator of the Mighty Minted site, recalled his own initial reaction.\n\"I signed up for an account, and then just instantly, it just clicked, it was like, this is the future. And this is now. And this is what collectibles are going to become in the future.\"\nFans of NFTs see them as an alternative to traditional collectors' markets that are often unregulated and opaque, whether involving sales of baseball cards or art works by masters.\n\"The technology is better than the offline world stuff,\" said Poland. \"I mean, there are fake Picasso's out there, there are fake Van Gogh's out there (whereas) these are confirmed to be real.\"\nOn Thursday, Christie's became the first big auction house to sell an NFT work: \"The First 5,000 Days\" by American digital artist Beeple, whose real name is Mike Winkelmann.\n\"We see this as a pivotal moment for the future of New Media and even the practice of collecting itself,\" Noah Davis, a Christie's expert in postwar and contemporary art, said in a statement.\nThe sale, which opened at a price of $100, has quickly soared to the lofty figure of $3 million. The sale ends on March 11.\nDavis compares the emergence of this form of collecting to that of street art, which in a few decades went from a frowned-on and even illegal practice to become a major trend in contemporary art collection.\nNFT-based art, Davis added, is \"on the threshold of becoming the next ingeniously disruptive force in the art market.\"\nNFT has a great future in the sports world as well, Poland says.\nOn Thursday, French soccer platform Sorare announced that it had raised $50 million from investors.\nAnd the Italian-based Panini company, long involved in the trading-card business and other collectibles, said it has also created its own blockchain-based site.\nPoland believes the new technology will initially work best with high-profile brands like the NBA, which are well-known by the public and confer a sense of trust in this completely new and unfamiliar universe.\nAs for prices, are we likely to see violent fluctuations -- as has been the case with cryptocurrencies?\n\"Some prices are a little out of whack,\" said Poland, \"and I think there will be some sort of correction.\"\nBut \"most likely the prices on NBA Top Shot right now are cheap,\" he said, and will seem even cheaper in 10 years' time.","201":"Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) workhorse, PSLV, on Sunday successfully launched Brazilian satellite Amazonia-1 along with 18 co-passenger satellites from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, 100 km from here.\nAmazonia-1 is an optical earth observation satellite that will provide remote sensing data to users for monitoring deforestation in the Amazon region and analysis of diversified agriculture across the Brazilian territory. Weighing 637 kg, it is the first dedicated commercial mission of NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), a Government of India company under Department of Space.\nPSLV-C51, carrying all 19 satellites, lifted off from the first launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre at 10.24 am. After a flight of about 17 minutes, the vehicle injected Amazonia-1 into its intended orbit and in the succeeding 1 hour 38 minutes, all the 18 co-passenger satellites successfully separated from the PSLV in a predetermined sequence.\nOne co-passenger satellite carried a picture of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while another had an e-copy of Bhagavad Gita on its SD card.\nAfter the successful launch, ISRO chairman Dr K Sivan said it was a proud moment for India and its space agency to the first satellite designed, integrated and operated by Brazil.\n\"Today is a very great day for the entire ISRO team and the PSLV-C51 is a special mission for India. Let me congratulate and compliment the team ISRO for achieving the precise injection of AMAZONIA-1 and 18 other satellites,\" he said.\nOf the 18 co-passenger satellites placed in the orbit, four are from ISRO's Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre and 14 from NSIL \u2013 13 of these are from the US.\n\u201cCongratulations to NSIL and @isro on the success of the 1st dedicated commercial launch of PSLV-C51\/Amazonia-1 Mission. This ushers in a new era of Space reforms in the country. 18 co-passengers included four small satellites that showcase dynamism and innovation of our youth,\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.\nPSLV-C51 is the 53rd flight of PSLV and 3rd flight of PSLV in 'DL' configuration (with 2 strap-on motors). ISRO said this was the 78th launch vehicle mission from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.","202":"India currently has a disappointing level of artificial intelligence (AI) development and it needs to embark on a rapid program to catch up, says a new book by researcher-author Rajiv Malhotra.\nIn Artificial Intelligence And The Future Of Power: 5 Battlegrounds, he argues that AI-driven revolution will have an unequal impact on different segments of humanity and for countries like India, where a large percentage of the population lacks the education that is vital to survive a technological tsunami, the adverse effects could be shattering.\nThere will be new winners and losers, new haves and have-nots, resulting in an unprecedented concentration of wealth and power. There is a real possibility that AI may trigger an unprecedented level of unemployment and precipitate social instability, he claims.\nAccording to Malhotra, India is an important case study on the impact of AI because that is where all the battles come together into one large and complex battleground.\n\"Indian society has forsaken its metaphysical roots in dharma to chase the Americanisation of artha (material pursuits) and kama (gratification of sensual desires). As a result, it is neither here nor there - having lost its traditional strengths both individual and collective, it is at best a poor imitation of the American dream,\" he says.\nAlso read: How to make artificial intelligence more democratic\nOverpopulation, unemployment and poor education make India especially vulnerable, he says, adding many of its industries are technologically obsolete and dependent on imported technologies.\n\"India presently has a disappointing level of AI development and it needs to embark on a rapid program to catch up,\" Malhotra writes in the book, published by Rupa Publications.\nHe also claims that India is not only lagging behind China in AI by at least a decade, but it also has routinely given away its unique data assets to foreign countries because of the ignorance of its leaders.\n\"If the present trajectory continues, India could be heading toward re-colonization, this time as a digital colony under the domination of the US and\/or China,\" he says.\nMalhotra says AI is amplifying human ingenuity and is the engine driving the latest technological disruption silently shaking the foundations of society.\n\"My use of the term is not limited narrowly to what AI is specifically in the technical sense, but also includes the entire ecosystem of technologies that AI propels forward as their force multiplier.

We are entering an epoch of disequilibrium in which a period of chaos is inevitable. Eventually, however, a new equilibrium will be established, and a new kind of world will emerge,\" he writes.

Our overall objective is to keep the BJP at bay. In Bengal, the basic alternative that is emerging, on the strength of the people\u2019s struggles in the past few months braving the repression of the TMC government, is the secular democratic alliance of Left-Congress. To defeat the BJP in Bengal, it is necessary to defeat the incumbent TMC government, which has facilitated the BJP\u2019s entry into the state. The anti-incumbency against the TMC government is the biggest feeder of the BJP in terms of vote share,\u201d CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said.\nRead | Gold loan waivers to wage hike: Politicians rush to woo voters in poll-bound Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Kerala\nIn 2016, the alliance secured 38 per cent of the votes, seven per cent fewer than what the TMC got.\nCPI (ML) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya, however, finds little merit in the alliance. The party, which recently won 12 out of the 19 seats it contested in the Bihar Assembly polls in alliance with once bitter rival RJD, has chosen to go solo in Bengal on 12 seats.\nThe CPI-(ML), he said, will lend its support to all non-BJP parties, including the TMC, if required.\n\u00a8Somewhere, the weakening of the Left in Bengal has allowed the BJP to emerge as a force in the state. The Left front has to identify that the BJP is the number one threat, not the TMC. Underestimating the BJP could be the biggest mistake here. We are not in a position to convince the CPI(M), so we decided to go alone.\n\u00a8Putting the TMC and the BJP in the same bracket is a mistake and could weaken the fight against the BJP in the state. Also, the viability of the Left Front-Congress alliance is yet to be proven,\u201d he said.\nThese issues are not unknown to the CPI(M) cadres on the ground and the Leader of the Left Legislature Party in the Assembly and CPI(M) MLA Sujan Chakraborty knows that.\n\u00a8At the end of the day, we want to defeat the TMC and the BJP, and along the way, some sacrifices have to be made. Our cadres understand that alliances need to be forged.

There will be continuity in the government. This is because of the work done by the LDF which was vindicated in the results of the local body polls.\n\u00a8In Kerala the BJP will be cut to size, but unfortunately, the Congress-led UDF is playing in tandem with the BJP in Kerala to defeat the LDF,\u201d he said.\nCPI General Secretary D Raja said, \u00a8In all these states, including in Assam, the general anti-incumbency is very high and the way NRC was dealt with and the extreme communal polarisation caused has resulted in the overarching desire of people to defeat the BJP.

It is not mere speculation anymore \u2013 Kamal himself told reporters on Saturday that he would welcome AMMK into the alliance but there will be no change in MNM's stand on him being the Chief Ministerial face.\nThe talk of a Third Front or alternative front gained momentum on Saturday after Kamal's colleague in tinsel town and politician, Sarath Kumar, met him and discussed the possibility of both coming together to fight the April 6 assembly elections. Sarath Kumar's AISMK has already entered into an electoral pact with IJK, headed by an educationist who is also a media baron controlling an influential television news channel in the state.\nAn activist all through his life has given his voice for several social causes, Kamal has been able to get retired and former bureaucrats, and activists to his fold.

Sagayam, who felt sidelined in the government due to his outspoken nature, was granted voluntary retirement from service recently after he sought the same.\nWhile all this may work as an advantage to Kamal, an alliance with AMMK, if it finally sees the light of the day, would raise questions on his \u201cchange agent\u201d plank.

If that is the case in NTK, imagine what kind of reaction it would lead to in our party.

If we look at the Lok Sabha result last time, since Rahul fought election from there, it had a major impact and we won 19 out of 20 seats. If he campaigns and concentrates heavily on Kerala, it would make a huge difference.\"\nOn the party deciding not to announce a CM face before polls, he said it was Congress' tradition not to declare a chief ministerial face before polls.\n\"After polls, according to the results, through consensus, the choice of the leader will be made,\" Anwar said.\nAsked about Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's remarks accusing Rahul Gandhi of \"speaking in the same tone\" as of Uttar Pradesh CM and BJP leader Yogi Adityanath against his government, he said nobody will believe this charge as the Congress has a history that it cannot have any understanding with communal forces.\nRahul Gandhi is leading a frontal attack on the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi which not only the Congress but other opposition parties are also recognising and praising, Anwar asserted.\nHe said such statements show that the LDF is \"nervous\"\nThey don't have the confidence in their Front it seems, he added.\nThe Congress leader exuded confidence in the UDF securing a comfortable majority and said its aim was to get a two-thirds majority so that it can provide a stable government that works freely for the development of the state.\nAnwar said talks were on for sealing the seat-sharing deal among UDF constituents and 50 per cent of the things had been finalised.\nPolling in Kerala for 140 seats of the Assembly will take place in a single phase on April 6.

On reaching there, he came to know that a woman Svetlana Alliluyeva was at the embassy with a pair of suitcases asking for asylum. She had presented a Russian passport and claimed to be Stalin's daughter.\n\"It didn't take much imagination to suspect the Russians were up to something. A few weeks earlier the Soviets had sent a new number two to their embassy in New Delhi who, according to the agency, specialised in black propaganda,\" the author says.\n\"\u2026 There were regular efforts to recruit young American officers by Soviet intelligence. The Stalin daughter ploy might be another effort to embarrass us,\" he claims.\n\"Her story was hard to believe. Not only did this woman say she was Stalin\u2019s daughter, she claimed to be the common-law wife of an older Indian gentleman who worked at the Foreign Language Press in Moscow\u2026\n\"Her husband had died the previous November. She had promised to bring his ashes from Moscow to immerse them in the Ganges. Six months had passed. She had stayed in India after scattering the ashes. She now wanted asylum,\" Celeste writes.\nAccording to him, all were worried that at \"any moment that she might cry rape or that the Soviet Embassy would allege we had kidnapped her. We would be ordered to produce her and she would confirm whatever wild accusations had been made by the Soviets\".\nSvetlana told the American officials she had come back to Delhi that weekend - March 5 was a Monday - and taken an apartment at the Russian Embassy compound. The Russians expected her to take the Aeroflot flight to Moscow very early Thursday morning.\nThe last straw, she alleged, occurred when the Soviet Ambassador invited her to lunch that afternoon and served Polish ham. She ate the vegetables on her plate but didn't touch the ham, thus offending the ambassador.\n\"What's happened to you,\" he asked her, adding whether she has become a \"vegetarian, a Hindu\", the book says.\nAfter talking to her at the consular office here, the Americans were left with three options - inform the Indian government and make a formal request for its help in facilitating her departure, turn her away or give a visa to the US but buy her a ticket only half way, Celeste recalls.\nSo it was decided to \"give her the visa and let her know she has got to get on the plane on her own\".\nSoon a cable message was sent to Washington around 2030 hours: \"Individual claiming to be Stalin's daughter arrived at Embassy 1910 hours seeking asylum. Unable to confirm identity. Concerned that individual may be a provocation. Propose to issue a US visa but send her to Rome on Quantas ETD 0100 hours. Seek your guidance.\"\nThere was a Quantas flight to Rome that would leave at one in the morning.\nThus Svetlana reached Rome from where she travelled to Geneva later.\n\"An already delicate situation became more delicate the next day when, at every post around the world, meetings between Soviet and American diplomats were called off. One of the reasons behind the Soviet Ambassador's eagerness to persuade Svetlana to return home was that he himself was headed back to Moscow for reassignment,\" the book says.\nThe KGB chief too was livid and demanded an answer from the CIA station chief in Delhi on why Svetlana was \"kidnapped\".\nCeleste claims that later it was found out that the \"Soviets had decided that Svetlana's departure was an Indian, not an American, problem\".\n\"The Indians had simply not taken proper care of this very important visitor. The Soviets went very hard at the Indira Gandhi government. After a couple of weeks LK Jha, the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister at the time, was sent by Indira Gandhi to meet Svetlana in Switzerland, where she'd moved,\" he writes.\n\"Jha tried to talk her into returning to Moscow saying that her defection was harming relations between two countries she loved and because her children wanted her back in Russia. One of her children was a doctor and the other was an academic, and she talked to them on the phone with Jha observing.\n\"The children urged her to return, but she refused, saying that she simply would not return to Moscow under any circumstances,\" the book says.\nEventually, Svetlana left Switzerland and came to the US. \"The brouhaha in Delhi subsided.\" ","229":"Flexible electronics such as folding display screens and wearable sensors are all the rage now, but circuits which are more prone to breaking means a higher rate of failure in such devices, scientists said. The result portends a higher burden on e-waste buildup in landfills.\nStudies have shown that these devices are prone to open-circuit failures due to mechanical stress from bending or stretching, electric stress from electrostatic discharge due to human contact, and even corrosion from moisture or sweat. \nThe devices threaten to add to the growing mountain of e-waste being generated worldwide - 53.6 million tonnes was generated worldwide in 2019.\nHowever, an innovation by scientists at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in the form of self-healing circuits, could extend the longevity of these devices and ease pressure on landfills.\n\u201cCircuit failure in these devices happens because of various mechanical stresses, such as rolling and bending, with the fatigue causing the \u2018interconnectivity\u2019 between circuits to crack. This results in black bands appearing on screens, but the cause of failure is really more varied than just a standard breakage between circuits. In wearable devices, corrosion is another cause of breaks,\u201d explained associate professor Sanjeev Sambandan, of the Department of Instrumentation and Applied Physics at IISc, who is the corresponding author for a paper published recently in the journal Advanced Electronics Materials. \n\nA graphic explaining a new self-healing electronic circuit developed by IISc. The innovation could help give longevity to flexible electronics.\n\nAlthough manufacturers of wearable devices have attempted to mitigate circuit failures through the use of polymers and other manufacturing methods, IISc said that a rethink in circuit design is needed to ensure the longevity of these products.\nIISc\u2019s own contribution, made in concert with the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom, is described as an add-on to existing manufacturing practices - that is using a pico litre of a special \u201coil\u201d that is printed over the circuits. \n\u201cWhen a circuit breaks, the open current induces particles in the \u2018oil\u2019 to align and form a conductive bridge, thereby completing the circuit and \u2018healing\u2019 it,\u201d Prof Sambandan explained.\nHe said IISc is also seeking to take the technology to satellites produced by the Indian Space Research Organization (Isro).\nE-waste challenges\nWhat would be the impact on ongoing e-waste generation and recycling? According to Shobha Raghavan, COO, Saahas Zero Waste (SZW), e-waste has already become a thorny proposition. Covid-19 is said to have resulted in buildup of e-waste quantities. \n\u201cWhile most electronics goods have reached the end of their service lives after years of use, wearable gadgets have already started coming in e-waste bundles,\u201d she said.\nAs the plastics and glass are not recyclable, they usually end up in landfills for burning. \u201cGlass from gadgets contains chemicals and so there is a toxic discharge during burning. There is a historic buildup of e-waste and gadgets are increasingly finding their way into the informal sector, which is adding to pollution,\u201d she added.\nShe said, however, that the largest sources of e-waste in the near future will be solar panels and electric car batteries.\nThe Karnataka State Pollution Control Board acknowledged that e-waste disposal is a challenge. \n\u201cThis is due to the lack of an organised chain to bring the different players together. We are working to address that problem,\u201d said Srinivasulu, member secretary, KSPCB.","230":"Monica Patel","231":"Kylian Mbappe scored twice to take his tally to 18 goals in Ligue 1 this season as Paris Saint-Germain eased to a 4-0 victory at bottom club Dijon on Saturday to keep the pressure on leaders Lille in the title race.\nMoise Kean and Danilo Pereira also scored for Mauricio Pochettino's team, who bounced back from a 2-0 home defeat by Monaco last weekend and moved back up to second in the table, a point behind Lille.\nThe leaders play on Sunday at home to Strasbourg, while Lyon are two points behind the capital club but can leapfrog them again with a win at Marseille, also on Sunday.\nFourth-placed Monaco are six points off top spot but can extend their unbeaten run to 12 games when they face Brest in the principality.\n\"I am very proud.

Besides aiding copious swing, it also slides off the surface quicker than its predecessors and also takes turn in a haphazard manner. \nWhile the unpredictability was ignored in the four Tests which were played in spin-friendly conditions (two in the UAE and two in India so far) despite spinners doing extremely well in three of those games, the latest episode has ensured it shall not be forgotten. Twenty-eight of the 30 wickets in the game were picked up by spinners in Ahmedabad. Subsequently, the pitch came under scrutiny. This, even after Joe Root and Rohit Sharma categorically stated that the ball wasn\u2019t playing how the red-ball or the white-ball does and that had something to do with the abysmal totals.  \nApparently, the bowlers had some concerns too, as R Ashwin announced on Saturday. \u201cWhen I bowled (in the nets), the balance of the ball was a lot different from the red-ball. When you try to put too much revs, it wasn\u2019t rotating as much at the seam as the red-ball would rotate. Clearly, when it lands on the glossy surface the ball would slide and if it all it lands on the seam, it was spinning big. It wasn\u2019t responding the way, the red ball was responding. Whatever was happening, was happening really quickly off the surface.\u201d\nParas Anand, the director of Meerut-based cricket equipment manufacturer Sanspareil Greenlands (SG), said that the extra layer of lacquer which keeps the ball newer for longer to assist swing also contributed to the speeding up of the ball after landing. \n\u201cWe were scared this would happen when they shaved the surface,\u201d he told DH. \u201cThe general practice is to keep enough grass on the surface so the ball won\u2019t deteriorate soon, but when they did remove the grass, we didn\u2019t have any history to base the ball\u2019s performance on. We were in the dark.\n\u201cBut I think the pink-ball generally comes on a bit faster than the conventional red-ball and white-ball and that\u2019s something batsmen will just have to adapt to. We are working on ways to reduce the gap but I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be able to achieve it because that lacquer layer is an essential characteristic.\u201d  \nAshwin maintained the new version of Test cricket will need to be given room to breathe before players adapt to it. \u201cWe are conditioned to playing with the red-ball and now all of a sudden, they have got in the pink ball,\u201d said the Indian off-spinner. \u201cThe pink-ball has brought a new dimension to the game, so it\u2019s about adapting. You play more and more and get used to it.\n\u201cThe same thing with ODIs. We were used to playing with the red-ball and then shifted to the white-ball. Initially, the white-ball was doing a lot. Now, it does nothing. That\u2019s how this format will also evolve. Anything new is going to have a lot of challenges.\u201d\nWaiting for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to get in touch with him after the series, Anand said he was prepared to take suggestions from players. \u201cSee, it\u2019s still early days.

They have been awaiting treatment as fund disbursal is ad hoc in the state, something that can be remedied if the Union Health Ministry comes out with a Rare Disease Policy before March 31 this year, as promised.\u201d\nIn a recent webinar, Dr Arundhati Chandrashekar, Mission Director, NHM, Karnataka, said, \u201cSince 2016, 22 patients with Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) have been treated in the state. This has been done at a cost of Rs 18 crore annually from the state budget. Around 30 patients with primary immunodeficiency disorders have also been treated at a cost of Rs 1 crore from other sources. Rare diseases are a neglected area.\u201d\nAdditional Chief Secretary, Health, Jawaid Akhtar, said, \u201cRare diseases are of low prevalence and individually rare, however collectively they effect a considerable level of population. The prevalence is 6 to 8% according to international research.\u201d\n\u201cWe are facing a long-drawn public interest litigation in Karnataka and based on the court order we are treating a good number of patients suffering from rare diseases. The expenditure might be up to Rs. 20 crore on a yearly basis,\u201d he added.\n\u201cConsidering the number of children suffering from rare diseases is large and the state cannot afford the finances required to treat them, we are one state which has been pressing for a Centrally-sponsored scheme so that the expenses can be shared with the Centre,\u201d he explained.\nEvery year the state government negotiates with the drug manufacturers about the drug quantity required. They provide 25% of the doses free. \u201cIf the economy of scale comes in, then the cost for the country as a whole will come down,\u201d Akhtar said.","243":"A few days ago, I attended a virtual talk titled \u2018Gods And Heroes\u2019 organised by the Bangalore International Centre. The talk was by Anna L Dallapiccola, renowned for her writings on South Indian paintings. Elaborately illustrated by visuals of 19 Kalamkari hangings from the collection of the Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum, London, the presentation was a feast for the eyes and the mind.\nKalamkaris are cloth hangings, which were commissioned by Hindu temples and mathas, monasteries, as well as by individuals for religious use. Long stretches of cloth, depicting stories from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Krishna Leela etc., were hung as backcloths of icons, or in temple courtyards, especially during festive seasons. They were produced by the Kalamkari process of free hand-drawing, mordant-dyeing and painting in natural or organic dyes on thick cloth, a complex technique that reached its highest expression in South India.\nThe majority of the 19 pieces in the collection that was presented, were from coastal Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Tamil and Telugu inscriptions helped the viewers decode the illustrated scenes.\nAll this material belonged to the 19th century, except for one remarkable 20th century hanging from Srikalahasti, which depicted the Life of Christ, in the style of a traditional Hindu Kalamkari hanging, drawn by artist and master craftsman Jonnalagadda Gurappa Chetty, renowned exponent of the art of Kalamkari from Srikalahasti in Andhra Pradesh. Gurappa Chetty had been commissioned to paint the \u2018The Life of Christ\u2019 Kalamkari by the Festival of India-UK Committee in 1985, confirmed Ambassador P A Nazareth, who was at that time, a member of the committee. \u201cYou would have noticed that every corner of the painting bore crosses,\u201d he said to me. \u201cThis symbolised the suffering and agony of Christ, which he bore for the love and everlasting redemption of humankind.\u201d\nI called J Niranjan, eminent Kalamkari artist and my friend at Srikalahasti. He is the only son of  Guruppa Chetty. I told him about this talk and that I was sending him a link to make sure that he showed it to his father. Nothing prepared me for the shock that was to follow my conversation. Niranjan told me that his father had passed away a few days ago (13 February 2021), having succumbed to a long illness. Gurappa Chetty was a titan in the world of arts and crafts in South India, someone who all of us revered and were so proud of. He had a special connection with Bengaluru. I was in tears and could not continue the conversation.\nNot an easy craft\nJonnalagadda Gurappa Chetty was born in 1937 in the temple town of Srikalahasti. His father J Lakshmaiah Chetty was one of the last surviving Kalamkari artists in Andhra Pradesh in the 1940s. Young Gurappa started learning his craft from his father at the age of 13. The art form was then known as Vrathapani, a special form of Kalamkari, which deals with the art of storytelling, patronised by the temples of South India. Around the 1940s, the craft began to dwindle, with growing loss of patronage from temples and zamindars. Gurappa Chetty felt that the government should actively help to preserve the culture of their peoples. The craft later on, came to be known as \u2018Kalamkari\u2019, which comes from the Urdu word \u2018kalam\u2019, which means pen and \u2018kari\u2019, which means craftsmanship. \nKalamkari is not an easy craft to master. It involves several long steps of priming the cotton cloth, with milk, alum dissolved in water, sheep or cow dung and constant washing under running water. Outlines of the drawings are done with bamboo pens in a black dye made with infused iron filings, fixed and then filled in with natural colours. Each colour has to be fixed before the next colour can be added, or else the colours will get smudged. The organic colours are said to have medicinal properties that protect the cloth from insects.\nGurappa became a school teacher, but he continued his work with Kalamkari painting. He underwent a Teacher\u2019s Training Course between 1955-57 and also between 1957-59 from the All India Handicrafts Board. \u201cGurappa Chetty came often to Bengaluru to conduct training programmes in Kalamkari and natural dyes at the Regional Design and Technical Centre,\u201d said Mr B M Dattatreya, former Deputy Director at the Centre, adding that he was a great teacher.\nMs Vimala  Rangachar, Patron and former Chairperson of the Crafts Council of Karnataka, mourns his passing away and remembers his great desire to propagate the craft form. He excelled in his craft and in recognition for his outstanding contribution to Kalamkari, was awarded the Presidential National Award for Craftsmanship in 1976, the title of ShilpaGuru in 2002, an award to celebrate the 50 years of All India Handicrafts Board (AIHB) and the Padma Shri in 2008.\nBig-hearted artist\n\u201cGurappaji was a man with a big heart and immense curiosity and interest in the social realities around him,\u201d says Gita Ram, a good friend of his and currently Chair of the National Apex Body, Crafts Council of India. He would come to Chennai often and update her about some new craft or craftsperson that he had learnt about. An expert in natural dyes, \u201cGurappa Chetty was a frequent visitor to the Dakshina Chitra Museum,\u201d says Deborah Thiagarajan, Founder and Managing Trustee of the Madras Craft Foundation that runs the Museum. \u201cGurappa Chetty gave me three indigo plants to grow in Dakshina Chitra to motivate me on the subject of natural dyes. When he visited next, he found that they had died. He gave me some more. But they also died and he then told me categorically that he would not give me any more,\u201d rues Deborah. The museum has four of his Kalamkari paintings, all on the subject of nature, a much-valued treasure trove.\nGurappa Chetty was a founder of the Paramparik Karigar, an association of craftspersons, formed in 1980, for the purpose of preserving and promoting the traditional arts and crafts of  India. The association strives for an environment conducive for the craftspersons to create their exquisite pieces of art and to create an awareness and understanding of the craft so that works of master craftsmen are recognised as art forms.\nWhat are the challenges that face the beautiful craft of Kalamkari? Should it continue to be practiced in the traditional manner, which its votaries like Gurappa Chetty believed so passionately in? Or should the craft modernise its process, develop and target new domestic and international markets, engage in new design development and product diversification? Addressing these questions would be the ideal tribute to an artist like Chetty.\nThe author is a former Chairperson of the Crafts Council of Karnataka.","244":"I currently feel like a student at a viva exam, sitting in front of four examiners,\u201d told a part-nervy and part-curious Parshwanath Upadhye, the Bengaluru-based Bharatanatyam dancer, eagerly awaiting the responses from an esteemed panel of dancers and critics (comprising Alastair Macaulay, Maya Kulkarni, Rama Vaidyanathan and Hema Rajagopalan) after a virtual screening of his dance presentation Veeta Var Abha.\nThe observers and the public at large were witness to an excerpt of it as part of First Look, a three-day-long virtual open rehearsal series where dancers shared a glimpse of a piece\/production that was (still in progress and) birthed during the pandemic. The event, which streamed live on Shaale.com, facilitated an important discussion among the dance fraternity, critics and the common man on the same forum.\nThe art fraternity, in many parts of the globe, has been quite receptive to the idea of open rehearsals. Artistes, before staging a performance for the public, are known to invite people from different walks of life to catch glimpses of their work. The subsequent feedback is viewed as a learning curve for the performers or an opportunity to lend a newer dimension to the presentation, even enhancing its impact. The results of this practice have been richly gratifying for both observers and artistes, regardless of the argument that the response to any work of art is subjective. Surprisingly enough, it hasn\u2019t gained precedence in a land that claims to be a melting pot of cultures.\nClassical dancers Dakshina Vaidyanathan Baghel, Shijith Nambiar, Parvathy Menon and Parshwanath had no reason to refuse when Akhila Krishnamurthy, the founder of the artiste-management and event curation firm Aalaap approached them with the idea to initiate the open-rehearsals trend here. \u201cI thought it may be interesting to create a platform where people share their works in progress with a group of informed artistes, mentors and critics. The pandemic was also a time off from the deadline of a performance; so I thought artistes may have had the luxury of working on a piece with a sense of leisure,\u201d Akhila felt.\nImpressive variety\nThe dancers\u2019 thematic choices lived up to expectations and boasted of impressive variety. Dakshina\u2019s solo piece Svaasthyam, inspired by the pandemic, in the form of a thillana discussed the significance of yogam, dhyanam and pranayama in the context of our mental health. Shijith and Parvathy gave a new spin to the ksheera sagara mathana episode in an evocative presentation, while Parshwanath\u2019s effort with his students was a seamless marriage of the Varkari Sampradaya and Bharatanatyam.\nFrom Ramaa Bharadvaj\u2019s fascinating textbook-like critique to Alastair Macaulay\u2019s enthusiasm to absorb the intricate meaning beneath the dance movements and Maya Kulkarni\u2019s ability to understand the interpretative quality of a piece (besides insights from critics Indira Kadambi, Chitra Sundaram, Aravinth Kumaraswamy) the dance connoisseur was left wanting for more. The impact of the pieces was partly dependent on the videography of a performance too; the choice of the right angles, shots, apt lighting and visual aesthetics proved crucial. Dakshina states \u201cI had used two cameras for my performance and had to choose shots that best captured the essence of my performance.\u201d\nEducative value\nThe educative value of the series can\u2019t be underestimated too, as it put an academic spotlight on the genesis of an idea, how it takes a concrete shape with choreography and can elicit a diverse range of reactions. \u2018Constructive criticism\u2019 can especially prove a touchy phrase when it involves a fraternity that holds its work extremely close to its heart. It was relieving and sportive of Parshwanath to say this in response to the fair bit of criticism he received from the observer panel, \u201cI didn\u2019t find their comments harsh because I think all artistes need it in some form. Otherwise, there\u2019s every danger of art remaining stagnant. The inputs gave me many ideas to approach the presentation with newer zest.\u201d\nHailing from a family that has a legacy in Bharatanatyam, Dakshina\u2019s observations on why open rehearsals aren\u2019t commonplace in India makes for interesting hearing too.\n\u201cAs someone who has been learning dance from a very young age, being critiqued is not so much of a problem. It becomes an ego when someone who critiques you isn\u2019t your guru or your well-wisher. When the latter does it, you don\u2019t take it to heart and understand that they are doing it with the best of intentions. So, the credibility of the person critiquing your performance too matters. In this event, though I didn\u2019t know what to expect, I went back being thoroughly enriched by the words of the panelists.\u201d\nFirst Look was a fine start to what should ideally be a regular feature in the Indian classical space in the times to come.","245":"-","246":"Ever wondered why the fried rice or hakka noodles made at home never gets that smoky flavour like in restaurants? It is not just the ingredients that make for tasty Chinese food, it is the science of the vessel and the method itself.  \nGood quality ingredients are crucial, but what is more important in Chinese cooking is the wok. But what does the vessel have to do with the flavour of the final dish, you may ask? A lot, really. A wok is not just any vessel made of iron. There is a whole lot of science involved in its functioning. If one observes a chef making Chinese food, the wok is all smoky and flames can be seen rising from the vessel. The high heat sears the outside of the vegetable or meat chunks and traps all the juices and flavour within. Even the ladle is designed to scoop and move food around the curved sides of the wok. Science, it seems, has not spared even cooking. Therefore, purchasing a wok (Rs 300-400) for a small family is money well spent. \nIt is not just Indo-Chinese food that will taste marvellous if cooked in a wok. We have all seen videos of biryani being cooked in a handi or a degchi. Both do not have straight sides, and there is a reason for that. In the dum pukht method of preparing biryani, the opening of the vessel is closed and sealed with dough for the magic to happen inside. While sealing, the vessel traps the flavours of the spices. The water added to cook the rice and vegetables or meat gets converted to steam, rises through the ingredients and cooks them on the way. When the steam hits the inside of the lid, it condenses into water droplets. The droplets come down the sloping side of the vessel and to the bottom. This process is repeated till flavourful biryani is ready.  \nIn the same way, take the kadai. This traditional Indian cooking vessel has a hemisphere-like shape that aids cooking like browning chopped onions, ginger or garlic for any dish. Or for that matter, try frying papad or vadas in a flat-bottomed vessel. One may be able to do it, but not with the same ease of doing it in a kadai. This is where our ancestors used their ingenuity even when it came to cooking vessels. Of course, many other materials like lead, clay, stone, cast iron etc., have been used since ancient times for cooking. Cooking in an iron or carbon steel vessel helps get a bit of the mineral into the body and that is beneficial. Basically, our ancestors had done their research with materials.\nThese days, many of us frequently use non-stick cookware, but awareness is growing about the need to use natural materials like iron. And that is a good sign. \n(The author takes refuge in food after a tiring day with cars and gadgets.)","247":"Two significant decisions by the judiciary in February of 2021 indicated the continuing shift in the judicial perception of LGBT rights ever since the Supreme Court decriminalisation in 2018 in the Navtej Singh Johar decision. On February 2, the Allahabad High Court ordered the reinstatement of an officer with the Home Guards who was dismissed because as the court puts it, \u2018some video of the petitioner was made viral by someone.\u2019\nThe court concludes that the reasons for the action by the superior officer were the \u2018perception of the officer\u2019 that \u2018sexual orientation of the petitioner is indulgence in untoward activity\u2019. This according to the court is in violation of the observations of the Apex Court in Navtej Singh Johar vs Union of India. The Allahabad High Court went on to note that the Supreme Court had held that \u2018any display of affection amongst the members of the LGBT community towards their partners in public, so long as it does not amount to indecency or has the potentiality to disturb public order cannot be bogged down by majority perception.\u2019\nOn February 4, 2021, the Delhi High Court in a petition asking for the protection of two young girls in a relationship with each other from the threats of the family members of one of them, ensured that the state gave the \u2018mobile numbers of the Beat Staff, Division Staff as also the SHO\u2019 to the two girls so that they could \u2018contact them in case of any problem\u2019. Both these decisions follow similar decisions by the Orissa and Kerala High Court indicating the effect of Navtej Singh Johar as precedent. Navtej is not just a decision that expresses fine sentiments but is actually changing attitudes and behaviours at the lower court level. The reason for the success of Navtej is that the decision was widely amplified by the media and this has a vital role to play in ensuring that there was no ignorance of the law.\nIn Navtej Singh Johar, J Nariman recognised the role of the media, when he ordered that, the \u2018Union of India\u2019 should \u2018ensure that this judgement is given wide publicity\u2019 using television, radio, print and online media at regular intervals,\u2019 as well as \u2018initiate programmes with \u2018police officials, and other officers\u2019 to \u2018reduce stigma\u2019.

The book, \u2018The Coronavirus: What You Need to Know about the Global Pandemic\u2019 shatters myths and manias that cajole the common man with quick-fixes that spell immeasurable doom.\nIt charts the history of past pandemics from the 100-year-old influenza pandemic or what is popularly known as Spanish Flu to the recent Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and explains the current one in the right context. The current times seem like a deja vu of past pandemics; the only exception being the rise of social media and the heightened antics of fear mongering that are prevalent today. An educational book, while charting history, also informs us about many scientific discoveries and the brains behind them \u2014 leading us to appreciate the scientific temper and ingenuity of the knights in lab coats and the humble origins of the technology that we see today.\nEerie stories\nAmong the many stories, the eeriest are those of Typhoid Mary and a cholera outbreak in London that began from a diaper \u2014 a story that is certain to make you put hygiene on the very top of your priority list!\nThe book explains the biology of virus replication, how our bodies react to being infringed upon by these microscopic beings; it also delineates several concepts, including the cytokine storm, concisely and lucidly.\nThe best aspect of the book is that it can even be understood by those who don\u2019t have a flair for science and the authors keep the tone light by adding pop culture references every now and then, from \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 to Pink Floyd.\nAll this makes it more appealing and sets it apart from literature, which may evoke a yawn for some or make one feel as if one is reading a textbook.\nFor example, we can gawk at the fact that a poorly-design sewage system of a building in Hong Kong led to the housing complex becoming a cluster. Such facts and trivia are amusing and educating at the same time.\nIt also covers the political and economic aspects of the pandemic and explores in detail the fallouts of WHO declaring the infection to be a pandemic and the US-China diatribe that followed after the communist country was accused of \u201cleaking\u201d the virus.\nAnalysing the spread in Iraq, Italy and other countries worst affected by the pandemic, it also shows how South Korea managed to reign in Sars-CoV-2, thus presenting a global picture of the pandemic.\nAs the course of the book runs, by using the tools it provides, one can bust many myths and fake news. The book too picks a few and shatters them. It rightfully bats for the betterment of the sorry state of our medical infrastructure and demands more allocation to the health sector. It also throws light on \u2014 what is now on everybody\u2019s lips\u2014 the conundrum of cure, a vaccine. It gyrates across subjects, analysing them through the lens of the pandemic and documenting this complex 360-degree view of the situation that has affected us all. In short, it\u2019s educative, engaging, optimistic and quite the read of the times.","251":"Samantha Shannon.(Pic courtesy: Louise Haywood-Schiefer)","252":"February 28 is National Science Day in India. I love all things science, and have strong opinions on the need for scientific thinking, especially in today\u2019s world. There\u2019s so much misinformation out there, and people are falling prey to it just because they don\u2019t ask for evidence.\nI\u2019m also a firm believer in starting young. If children grow up with a scientific mindset, it is more likely that citizens in the future will trust evidence-based information, and take informed decisions.\nBut I get it. Many kids think science is boring, and reading science beyond textbooks can feel like a drag. But the happy news is that there are a variety of books out there that introduce science to kids in different ways, so the child can choose what works for them. I\u2019ve experimented with different kinds of science writing, my latest being How We Know What We Know, with 50 fascinating stories of discovery and invention, dealing with varied topics like migration, rockets, toilets, relativity, barcodes, 3D-printing, the first movie, and so on. Some children prefer it this way, exciting real-life stories packed with facts.\nA Really Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson gives a hilarious, quick overview of, well, everything, but there\u2019s a lot of science in there, and this format might work best for some kids. Others thrive on biographies, and there are heaps of scientist bios in the market. I have personal experience with those of Curie, Einstein and Galileo written by various authors and published by the Chicago Press Review. My mother bought a bunch of these in-depth biographies, and she and my daughter have been reading them together over video calls (priceless, especially during the pandemic.)\nSpeaking of scientists, generally, most people think of scientists as old white men, and of scientific research as something that is happening in remote labs elsewhere. For children who tend to be inspired by heroes they see around them, this book might work well: 31 Fantastic Adventures in Science: Women Scientists in India by Nandita Jayaraj and Aashima Freidog, about Indian scientists who are currently involved in scientific research.\nWhat If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions by Randall Munroe, for older kids, is a fun book full of mind-bending problems that force you to think. Children who prefer fiction might gravitate towards books with a blend of science and fiction.\nThe Calpurnia Tate series by Jacqueline Kelly happens to be a favourite of both my daughter and me. It is a historical fiction novel of a girl in early 20th century Texas, who loves science.\nScience fiction has got many scientists started on their journey, and is a wonderful way of appreciating the vast possibilities of science. The classic The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams is a great beginning. Once children find the kind of science that appeals to them, and science becomes a way of life, they\u2019ll learn to ask questions, and demand evidence, and that\u2019s what the world needs.\nThe author has written 10 books for children and can be reached at www.shruthi-rao.com\nGobbledyBook is a fortnightly column that gives a peek into the wondrous world of children\u2019s books.

The ethereal beauty and grandeur of Bundi architecture are vividly brought out in the palaces of India.\nThe little town once famous for its Baories (reservoirs) and miniature paintings attracts travellers from far and wide as the city itself seems like a miniature painting frozen in time. The place is also a budding bird watchers\u2019 paradise and a historical rock shelter destination.\nThe tinsel town has many exquisite rural excursions one of which is Dugari in Nainwa subdivision.

The reddish-purple stamp did not portray the pontiff. Instead, it bore the likeness (based on an image in an Italian cathedral) of St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ. St Thomas brought Christianity to India long before the coming of the western powers who engaged in commerce, conquest, and conversion. Travelling by sea from Palestine, St Thomas landed at the ancient port of Muzaris, now Kodungalloor in Kerala.\nA bas-relief depicting his arrival is on display at the Maritime Museum in Kochi. Although St Thomas is inextricably linked with Tamil Nadu, where his mission ended in martyrdom in AD 72, it was in Kerala that he first began to spread Christ\u2019s teachings. There is fascinating evidence in that State of the houses of worship that he founded. Popularly known as the \u2018seven and a half churches\u2019, the strange-sounding half\u2019 is a small shrine in Tamil Nadu.\nA place in Kerala, closely associated with St Thomas, is Niranam (about 88 km from Kochi), in Tiruvalla. St Thomas seems to have gone there soon after he entered our country, approaching the village through the Kottachal waterway (a tributary of the Pampa River). At Niranam, St Thomas preached, among others, to Brahmin and Buddhist scholars. Since Jews had been living in Cochin (Kochi) long before the birth of Jesus, St Thomas would have interacted with them as well. Those who embraced his message became the earliest Christians in India.\nDuring a second sojourn in Niranam, St Thomas established the Church that is known today, both as the St Mary\u2019s Orthodox Syrian Church and Niranam Valiya Pally. Dating back to AD 54, it is one of the oldest churches in the world. The building, however, bears no resemblance to the original structure. The Church has been reconstructed at least four times, including once in the mid-13th century. A cross made of granite, near the gate of the Church, belongs to that period. The present edifice is over a hundred years old, but its well-preserved appearance belies its age. The Church has a contemporary fa\u00e7ade, owing to a renovation in 2000.\nDistinctly different is the spacious interior of the Church, where a solemn sense of the past prevails. Five altars are dedicated to various saints, including St Thomas.\nThe main one, consecrated to St Mary (in keeping with the name of the Church) is richly embellished and adorned by a beautiful painting.

I wanted to join a sports club but my dad won\u2019t allow me to go anywhere apart from college and home. I feel my friends love me unconditionally more than my family. I feel alone and sometimes I really want to commit suicide. Please help.\nKumari\nHi Kumari,\nFirst of all, don\u2019t take thoughts of suicide lightly. Find a free helpline online and speak to a counsellor. I am sorry your folks aren\u2019t being a good sport about your interest in sports. Can\u2019t you play and train in college? Don\u2019t worry about not being considered an achiever now. Some of us soar heights a little later than others and that\u2019s okay. If sports is what you love, go after it with a passion. Play, read sports writing, sports autobiographies, write about it \u2014 there are many ways to pursue your passion other than a sports club. Think of yourself as a marathon runner. You need stamina, guts, and sheer willpower to get where you want to be. Game on.\nMadam,\nI am a 45 year old man and I have a habit of wearing women\u2019s lower underwear. I have 10 to 15 fancy panties in my collection of different patterns. I purchase them myself and wear them to feel happy. Though I am married, I am not able to overcome this habit. Is it common in some men and women? Is it bad for our body?\nMr Feels Nice\nMr Feels Nice,\nDon\u2019t be under the weather because of underwear. In brief, it\u2019s not bad. You are not harming anybody by wearing your happiness. Lawngerie is perfectly legal. Your secret is also Victoria\u2019s Secret. So have fun Mr Fancy Panties, there\u2019s nothing thong about it.\nHiya SS,\nI\u2019m a very attractive and good-looking man. I\u2019m also charming, nice and very decent but I still can\u2019t find a girlfriend. Even when I tell them how much I earn, they never get impressed. My whole family says that any girl will be lucky to have me as their partner but nobody wants to go out with me. What am I doing wrong?\nMr Super Hot\nHiya Super Hot,\nMaybe you need to cool down. People who brag can be a drag. Stop praising yourself. On a date, see what\u2019s great about your partner and consider why you are lucky to be with her. Even if you don\u2019t feel this way, act like you do. Remember, modesty is the art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it.","259":"","260":"Seeds are ambitious. They seek new places to grow and thrive. Some seeds stick to the feathers of birds that visit the plant and ride on them. Some seeds, consumed by birds and grazing animals, pass through the digestive system to reach a new place. Some develop adept wings to fly. Some drift in the water for nearly three years until they wash up on a beach. Some seedpods explode and seeds (like missiles) travel a distance to land in a new place. \nMy earliest memory of watching seedpods scatter was of Crossandra infundibuliformis, commonly known as kanakambara\/kanakambari. It explodes with a loud noise while dispersing seeds and is therefore called the Firecracker Flower. Some other common plants that disperse seeds are Butterfly Pea, Buddha Belly, Balsams, Impatiens, Yellow Bauhinia, and Calliandra. \nIn 1963, while excavating Herod\u2019s palace in Masada, archaeologists discovered a jar of palm seeds. Forty years after unearthing them, scientists grew a few into palm trees. At the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, a blooming Sacred Lotus attracts tourists; for a reason. The lotus bloomed from an ancient seed, nearly 1,300 years old. One of the most significant discoveries was in Siberia, on the banks of the Kolyma river. Mature and immature frozen seeds belonging to Narrow-Leafed Campion were found in squirrel hibernation burrows, 125 feet below the ground. They were 32,000 years old, kept safe by permafrost. Even though humans have spent tens and thousands of years with plants, how long a seed can stay alive and viable, remains a mystery to us.\nPreparing the soil\nWhat is the best season to seed a garden? In India, it is Spring(February\/March). Whatever sort of garden you would like to grow, make sure you have adequate sunlight and space for plants. A soil mixed with compost and sand is ideal for cultivation. While the soil absorbs the moisture, the compost provides essential nutrients. The sand keeps the layers porous and helps in draining the excess water. \nMix the soil, compost and sand thoroughly. Make sure it is powdery to touch. If you are transferring it to pots, prepare the pot. Ensure that there is a drain hole at the bottom for excess water to leave. Layer the bottom of the pot with pebbles for nearly an inch. Top it with a layer of sand. Finally, fill three-fourths of the pot with the soil mixture. There is a reason for layering it in this method. When you feed water, the upper and middle layer will absorb maximum water. The rest flow down through the sand and pebbles, preventing water accumulation. \nChoosing the right seeds\nYou have a variety of seeds to choose from if you are buying from a store. Choose organic seeds for a good yield. Once you have grown a cycle of crops, you can harvest seeds for the next season. If you have unused ones, you can preserve them by sealing them in a paper cover and placing them in an airtight box. Store them in a dark corner of your garden cupboard. \nBefore you begin, it is essential to know how tall and wide the plant will grow. This helps in sowing the seed at an adequate distance. If you are unsure, sow seeds six to eight inches apart till the seedling stage and replant later. Use your finger and draw a line or make a hole in the soil. Drop a few seeds in the hole or in the middle of the line. Now cover with a layer of soil as thick as the seed. If you sow them too deep, the germinated seed will be under the ground for too long, unable to harness sunlight for photosynthesis and will die. Big seeds like beans and peas are sown deeper. Sprinkle water using a sprinkler or a sprayer to wet the soil. Keep the soil moist until they germinate. \nIf you are not sure about the quality of seeds, you can germinate them before sowing. Seed germination is similar to sprouting legumes for a salad. Soak the seeds for eight hours. Drain the water. Spread them on one side of a wet cloth, fold the other half over, and place it in a warm place.\nWithin a few days, germination will begin. You can eliminate the un-germinated seeds and transfer the good ones to the soil. These are some of the basic rules of selecting a seed and preparing the soil. In the next column, we will see how to grow a simple vegetable garden.\nUntil then, happy gardening.

But it had failed to find the companies to implement the project based on the panel\u2019s recommendations. The experts were also part of a Supreme Court-appointed committee on solid waste management. \nThe civic body had planned to carry out bio-mining on legacy waste deposited in various corners of Bengaluru. \nWhile experts had suggested bio-mining at Mandur, Mavallipura, Lakshmipura and Bingipura landfills, the BBMP focused on Mandur where about 18.91 lakh tonnes of legacy waste is waiting to be mined since garbage dumping was stopped in December 2014. \nAn expert from the solid waste roundtable said bio-mining was a scientific process to clear the waste deposited in a landfill by splitting the organic and non-organic waste and process what is recyclable. \n\"The recyclables include plastic, metals, glass and similar substances. With the organic materials, we could have obtained methane gas, compost or refuse-derived fuel (RDF) used for various secondary purposes,\" the expert explained. \nN Ramakanth, a member of the SWM committee, said: \"We have been after the idea for almost a decade. But till this day, not a single kilo of waste has been removed.\" \nDelay in disposing the waste deposited in the landfills has affected the livelihood of local people, Ramakanth added, noting that the landfill could have spoiled the groundwater in the area due to consistent seepage during the rains, while also causing air pollution and diseases.\n\"Several municipalities are successful at (biomining); the nearest example being Hosur in Tamil Nadu,\u201d he said. \nSources said three companies had initially submitted their bids and 17 more had given proposals to mine the landfills.\nDoing our best: Palike \nSarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, BBMP, said they had been doing their best to implement the project since 2016. \u201cBut the response for the tender is poor,\u201d he said. \n\u201cSome bidders are technically strong, but don\u2019t have the financial stability to carry out biomining in a vast area we have.

BBMP engineers told DH that all recyclable waste will be extracted. \n\u201cThe compost can be subsequently utilised at the spot to set up a biodiversity park. The methane gas can be used to generate energy and the RDF be diverted to fill up the low-lying areas of the quarry pits and sent to the cement industries,\u201d an engineer explained.\nAfter visiting the landfills and analysing the materials, the experts told BBMP that about 30% of the waste \u2014 mud used to cover the waste after every layer of dumping \u2014 will be silt. Along with the organic material, it could be used as a soil conditioner.\nA further 20%-25% will be plastic, glass and PET bottles that could be recycled and only about 20% of the materials at the landfills need to be scientifically disposed of, the experts added.","266":"With the number of fresh Covid-19 cases in Yelahanka clusters rising from 28 to 33 on Saturday, Health Commissioner Dr Thrilok Chandra said that the Health Department would have to relook quarantine guidelines from Maharashtra and Kerala. \nCurrently, there is no quarantine watch app and even the Aarogya Setu app does not ensure that travellers from these two states stay put at home without any contact for two weeks, which was the case last year and this year with international travellers. \n\u201cAs of now, we have mandated a negative RT-PCR certificate but if any symptoms arise, they have to self-quarantine and observe themselves, and have a follow-up RT-PCR test.

Koshyari.\nWhile sources said the two VCs cited personal reasons for their decision, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (AVBP), which is the students' wing of the BJP, alleged that they quit due to \"political interference\" by the state government.\nWhen asked about the resignation of the two VCs, Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said this is a serious issue and the governor should take cognisance of it.\nAccording to sources, Governor Koshyari, who is the chancellor of universities in the state, has accepted the resignations of Pradip Patil, who was the VC

He washed his face, put on a baseball cap and face mask and told his wife he would have the coffee she had prepared for him when he returned. Then, on a brisk and misty Northern California winter morning last month, he stepped outside.\nAbout an hour later, Vicha, an 84-year-old retired auditor from Thailand, was violently slammed to the ground by a man who charged into him at full speed. It was the type of forceful body blow that might have knocked unconscious a young football player in full protective pads. For Vicha, who stood 5 feet, 6 inches and weighed 113 pounds, the attack was fatal. He died of a brain hemorrhage in a San Francisco hospital two days later.\nCaptured on a neighbor\u2019s security camera, the video of the attack was watched with horror around the world. Among Asian Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the coronavirus pandemic, the killing of a defenseless older man became a rallying cry.\nIn the past year, researchers and activist groups have tallied thousands of racist incidents against Asian Americans, a surge in hate that they link to former President Donald Trump repeatedly referring to the coronavirus as the \u201cChinese virus.\u201d Vicha\u2019s family described his killing as racially motivated, and it spurred a campaign to raise awareness by many prominent Asian Americans, who used the online hashtags #JusticeForVicha and #StopAsianHate.\n\u201cThe killing of Vicha was so plain as day,\u201d said Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor who, after watching the video, flew from New York to San Francisco to help lead protests and safety patrols in Asian neighborhoods. \u201cThere was no longer any way to ignore the violence that was happening to people who look like us.\u201d\nAntoine Watson, a 19-year-old resident of neighboring Daly City, was arrested two days after the attack and charged with murder and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty, but his lawyer admits that his client had an \u201coutburst of rage.\u201d\nChesa Boudin, the San Francisco district attorney, said Vicha\u2019s death was heinous. But he said there is no evidence to suggest it was motivated by racial animus.\nStill, at a time when demands for racial justice have rocked a demographically evolving nation, the killing of Vicha was notable for the galvanizing anger it brought to a diverse group that encompasses people of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, South Asian and Southeast Asian heritage. The killing of a Thai man in America has given voice to a united community under the umbrella of an Asian American identity.\n In the weeks since it happened, Vicha\u2019s death has become a symbol for the vulnerability that many in the Asian American community feel in this moment.\nFor his family, the death has been devastating both in California and abroad. In Thailand, the killing was front-page news and described as barbaric, a life cut short in a family where siblings typically live into their late 90s, relatives said.\n)\nSince his retirement in 1996 from Kasikornbank, one of Thailand\u2019s largest financial institutions, Vicha had traveled between San Francisco, where his eldest daughter lives, and Thailand, where his youngest does.\nFor months Vicha had been pining to return to Thailand but was unable to because of the pandemic. He disliked the chilly and wet San Francisco winter and missed his favorite southern Thai dishes and his extended family and friends.\n His brother, Surachai Ratanapakdee, 89, now the only surviving sibling of eight children, remembered Vicha as studious and curious about the world outside the rice paddies, watermelon fields and orchards of the family farm.\n\u201cVicha was one of only a few people in the village who spoke English well,\u201d Surachai said.\nVicha went on to study at Thammasat University in Bangkok, one of the country\u2019s most prestigious institutions.\n His older daughter, Monthanus, described her father as a devoted Buddhist. She remains puzzled why on the morning of the attack he left without his Buddhist amulet, a talisman of protection that he always wore around his neck.\nWhen Monthanus expressed her desire to go to graduate school two decades ago, Vicha supported her decision to enroll in business school at the University of California, Berkeley. After her graduation, when Monthanus married and decided to stay in San Francisco, Vicha and his wife came to help raise their grandchildren.\nAt the time of the attack, Vicha was only months away from being able to return to Thailand. On Jan. 15, he received the first shot of the Moderna vaccine.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Dad, we are going to go back soon!\u2019\u201d Monthanus recalled.\nVicha\u2019s second shot was scheduled for Feb. 12, an appointment he would not live to make.\nHis killing came at a time when other disturbing images and reports were emerging from across the San Francisco Bay. Three days later an attacker shoved a 91-year-old man in Oakland\u2019s Chinatown to the ground, another video that rocketed around the internet.\nThat older victim has been wrongly described in many news accounts as Asian. Court documents give the victim\u2019s name as Gilbert Diaz, and Carl Chan, a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, said the victim was Latino. But Chan said he has tallied more than two dozen assaults against Asian American victims in Chinatown, including two other people shoved by the assailant who knocked down Diaz.\nCrime data from the district attorney offices in San Francisco County and Alameda County, which includes Oakland, show that people of Asian descent were less likely last year to be victims of crimes than other ethnic groups. In San Francisco, where 36% of the population is of Asian descent, 16% of crime victims of known ethnicity were Asian, a similar situation to Alameda County.\nBut leaders of the Bay Area Asian community said crime statistics are misleading because Asian American residents, especially immigrants, often do not report assaults or robberies out of mistrust of the system or language barriers. What is incontrovertible, said leaders of the Asian American community nationwide, is that the pandemic created a climate of fear and a feeling of insecurity from New York to California. In the past week the California Legislature approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against Asian Americans.\n \u201cOur seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,\u201d Chan said.\nLast year Monthanus, Vicha\u2019s daughter, was twice accosted on the street by people who told her to leave the country because, the attackers said, Asians had caused the coronavirus.\n Watson\u2019s lawyer, Sliman Nawabi, a public defender, said his client would not have been able to identify Vicha\u2019s ethnicity through his face mask, cap and winter clothing. Nawabi described Watson as someone who had struggled with anger.\nIn the hours before the attack, Watson had a string of setbacks. He left his home because of a family dispute and got in a traffic accident in San Francisco at 2 a.m. He was cited by the San Francisco police for running a stop sign and reckless driving and then slept that night in his car.\nOn that morning a number of security cameras in the area captured Watson banging a car with his hand, according to Boudin, the district attorney.\n\u201cIt appears that the defendant was in some sort of a temper tantrum,\u201d Boudin said.\nIt was then that Vicha walked up Anzavista Avenue, a street with views of skyscrapers in the city\u2019s financial district.\nA witness told police officers that Watson said something to the effect of, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d A security camera located inside a neighbor\u2019s apartment captured Watson charging across the pavement toward Vicha, who briefly turned to his assailant before the impact.\n Two days after the attack, Monthanus and her mother went to the spot where Vicha was killed and saw that his blood still stained the pavement. They scrubbed the sidewalk with brushes and wondered why no one from the city had come to do the same.\nVicha\u2019s cremated remains have been placed in two urns. Monthanus said she and her family will charter a boat under the Golden Gate Bridge and scatter some into the Pacific Ocean.\n\u201cI want him to be close to me,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we go to the beach, we can dream that he is with us.\u201d\nShe plans to bring the other urn back to her father\u2019s hometown in southern Thailand, where the local Buddhist temple has a stupa that holds the family\u2019s remains. \u201cHis brothers and sisters are there,\u201d Monthanus said. \u201cThey will all be together.\u201d\nThe amulet, a precious family heirloom, will be passed to the next generation, Monthanus said.\n\u201cHe always told me that if something happened to him, this must be passed on to grandchildren,\u201d she said.","289":"The US government on Saturday authorised Johnson & Johnson's single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, enabling millions more Americans to be vaccinated in the coming weeks and setting the vaccine up for additional approvals around the world.\nThe J&J vaccine is the third authorised in the United States, following ones from Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna, both of which require two doses.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration announced the emergency use authorisation of the J&J vaccine for adults aged 18 and older following Friday's unanimous endorsement by the agency's panel of outside experts. Shipments to vaccination sites are expected to begin Sunday or Monday.\nPresident Joe Biden hailed the move but cautioned Americans against celebrating too soon. \"Things are still likely to get worse again as new variants spread,\" he said in a statement, urging people to continue washing their hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distancing.\nRead | Johnson & Johnson's single-dose vaccine effective against Covid-19\n\"There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable,\" he said.\nBoth the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are based on new messenger RNA technology, showed higher efficacy rates in pivotal trials that used two doses versus J&J's single-shot vaccine. Direct comparison, however, is difficult because the trials had different goals and J&J's was conducted while more contagious new variants of the virus were circulating.\n\"We believe that people should take the vaccine they are able to access,\" the FDA's acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said in a call after the authorisation, noting the three vaccines had not been studied head-to-head.\nAlso read: All you need to know about Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine authorised in US\n\"We feel that each of these vaccines will be effective, will prevent hospitalization, deaths and should be used,\" she said.\nIn J&J's 44,000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe Covid-19 four weeks after inoculation. It was 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to the virus.\nThere were very few serious side effects reported in the trial, which also offered preliminary evidence that the vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections.\nMore study is expected. The FDA on Saturday dismissed the idea that evidence proved the vaccine prevented transmission between people and added there was no data to determine how long the vaccine's protection lasted.\nJ&J's vaccine is expected to be used widely around the globe because it can be shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making distribution easier than for the Pfizer\/BioNTech SE and Moderna vaccines, which must be shipped frozen.\n\"It potentially could play a very substantial role if we have enough doses because it's only a single-dose vaccine and that will make it attractive to people who are difficult to reach,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. \"It's one and done.\"\nThe US government, which has purchased 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine, plans to distribute about 3 million to 4 million next week. That would be on top of the around 16 million doses of the Pfizer\/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines the government already planned to ship across the country.\n\"We are ready to roll it out,\" White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt wrote on Twitter after the authorisation. Johnson & Johnson said it had begun shipping vaccines to the government.\nJ&J plans to provide a total of 20 million doses by the end of March, which along with the more than 220 million total doses expected from Pfizer and Moderna would be enough to fully vaccinate 130 million Americans.\nSo far, the United States has distributed more than 90 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, some of which have been used for second shots. About 14% of Americans have received at least one dose, according to US government data.\nCovid-19 has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States, and states are clamoring for more doses to stem cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.\nPublic health officials have warned about a rise in the prevalence of more contagious variants of the virus, adding to the urgency to get millions more people vaccinated as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, they said, mask wearing and other measures to curb the virus spread should remain in place as recent declines in Covid-19 cases appear to be leveling off.\nAlso Read | AstraZeneca, Sputnik, Johnson & Johnson vaccines face hurdles if Covid-19 shots become annual affair\nThe J&J vaccine is also under review by the European Union, where deliveries are expected starting in April and would build on the region's thin supplies of the Pfizer\/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc shots.\nIn South Africa, regulators were awaiting the FDA decision as their government looks to deploy more J&J vaccine against a variant of the virus called B.1.351 that is able to evade some vaccine protection.\nJ&J's vaccine is being rolled out there prior to official authorisation for about 500,000 healthcare workers in a bid to stem infections from the variant, which has swept across the country and spread globally, including to the United States.\nThe vaccine is one of the few that has been tested in clinical trials against the variant and had a 64% efficacy rate at preventing moderate-to-severe disease in South Africa.\nJ&J said on Friday that the company was developing a second-generation vaccine that would target the concerning South African variant, and it will be ready to start Phase I trials by this summer.\nJ&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response. J&J is testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, with results expected this summer.","290":"President Joe Biden on Saturday said his administration would make an announcement on Saudi Arabia on Monday, following a US intelligence report that found Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had approved the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\nAlso read: Khashoggi murder case: US seeks to put Saudi crown prince in his place - for now\nAsked about punishing the crown prince, Biden said: \"There\u2019ll be an announcement on Monday on what we\u2019re going to be doing with Saudi Arabia generally.\"\nBiden did not provide details.
